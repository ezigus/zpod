# Dev Log: Issue 02.1.3 - Batch Operations and Episode Status Management

**Status**: ✅ Phase 1 Completed  
**Implementation Date**: 2024-12-27  
**Developer**: GitHub Copilot  

## Issue Overview

Issue 02.1.3 focused on enhancing the existing batch operations infrastructure and episode status management system with improved visual feedback, error handling, and user experience features.

## Architecture Analysis

Upon examining the codebase, I found that substantial batch operation infrastructure already existed:
- Basic BatchOperationManager with progress tracking
- Multi-select mode with checkboxes and visual feedback  
- Selection methods (All, None, Invert, Criteria-based)
- Episode status indicators and progress views
- Comprehensive test coverage foundation

The task was to enhance existing functionality rather than build from scratch.

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Enhanced Status Management and Visual Feedback ✅

#### 1. Enhanced Episode Status Visualization
**Files Modified**: `EpisodeListView.swift`

**Changes**:
- **Enhanced Status Icons**: Added comprehensive status system for all episode states (played/unplayed, downloading, failed, archived, rated)
- **Single-Tap Status Toggle**: Users can now tap status icons to toggle played status with immediate visual feedback
- **Archive & Rating Indicators**: Episodes show archive status (orange archive icon) and star ratings (1-5 stars)
- **Failed Download Retry**: Added retry buttons for failed downloads with red warning icons

**Code Example**:
```swift
// Enhanced play status indicator with single-tap functionality
Button(action: {
    onPlayedStatusToggle?()
}) {
    Group {
        if episode.isPlayed {
            Image(systemName: "checkmark.circle.fill")
                .foregroundStyle(.green)
        } else if episode.isInProgress {
            Image(systemName: "play.circle.fill")
                .foregroundStyle(.blue)
        } else {
            Image(systemName: "circle")
                .foregroundStyle(.secondary)
        }
    }
    .font(.title3)
}
```

#### 2. Enhanced Download Status Management
**Files Modified**: `EpisodeListView.swift`, `EpisodeListViewModel.swift`

**Changes**:
- **Download State Visualization**: Enhanced indicators for downloading, downloaded, failed, and not-downloaded states
- **Progress Indicators**: Added animated progress bars for downloads with pause/resume button placeholders
- **Retry Functionality**: Failed downloads show retry buttons with automatic status updates
- **Visual Feedback**: Status changes animate smoothly with color-coded feedback

#### 3. Enhanced Batch Operation Progress
**Files Modified**: `BatchOperationViews.swift`

**Changes**:
- **Enhanced Progress View**: Added retry and undo functionality to BatchOperationProgressView
- **Visual Styling**: Status-based background colors and borders for better visual feedback
- **Retry Options**: Failed operations show retry buttons with detailed error information
- **Undo Functionality**: Reversible operations display undo buttons after completion
- **Better Error Handling**: Clear indication of failed operations with retry options

**Code Example**:
```swift
// Enhanced progress view with status-based styling
.background(backgroundColorForStatus)
.cornerRadius(12)
.overlay(
    RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 12)
        .stroke(borderColorForStatus, lineWidth: 1)
)

// Success message with undo option for reversible operations
if batchOperation.status == .completed && batchOperation.operationType.isReversible {
    HStack {
        Text("Operation completed successfully")
            .font(.caption)
            .foregroundStyle(.green)
        
        Spacer()
        
        if let onUndo = onUndo {
            Button("Undo", action: onUndo)
                .font(.caption)
                .foregroundStyle(.orange)
        }
    }
}
```

#### 4. Enhanced View Model Logic
**Files Modified**: `EpisodeListViewModel.swift`

**Changes**:
- **Status Toggle Methods**: Added `toggleEpisodePlayedStatus()` for immediate UI updates
- **Download Management**: Added `retryEpisodeDownload()` and `pauseEpisodeDownload()` with visual feedback
- **Batch Operation Enhancements**: Added `retryBatchOperation()` and `undoBatchOperation()` with smart operation reversal
- **Quick Play**: Added `quickPlayEpisode()` for in-progress episodes

**Code Example**:
```swift
/// Undo a completed batch operation if it's reversible
public func undoBatchOperation(_ batchOperationId: String) async {
    if let batchIndex = activeBatchOperations.firstIndex(where: { $0.id == batchOperationId }) {
        let batchOperation = activeBatchOperations[batchIndex]
        
        guard batchOperation.operationType.isReversible else { return }
        
        // Create reverse operation
        let reverseOperationType: BatchOperationType
        switch batchOperation.operationType {
        case .markAsPlayed:
            reverseOperationType = .markAsUnplayed
        case .favorite:
            reverseOperationType = .unfavorite
        // ... other reversible operations
        }
        
        // Execute reverse batch operation
        let undoBatch = BatchOperation(
            operationType: reverseOperationType,
            episodeIDs: batchOperation.operations.map { $0.episodeID },
            playlistID: batchOperation.playlistID
        )
        
        let _ = try await batchOperationManager.executeBatchOperation(undoBatch)
    }
}
```

#### 5. Enhanced Test Coverage
**Files Modified**: `BatchOperationTests.swift`

**Changes**:
- **Retry Functionality Tests**: Added tests for batch operation retry scenarios
- **Reversible Operations Tests**: Added tests to verify which operations are reversible
- **Undo Functionality Tests**: Added tests for operation reversal logic
- **Enhanced Error Handling Tests**: Verified retry and error handling improvements

## Technical Decisions

### Swift 6 Concurrency Compliance
- All new callback methods follow strict concurrency requirements
- Used `@MainActor` isolation for UI-related methods
- Proper async/await patterns for all background operations
- `Sendable` conformance maintained for all data models

### User Experience Philosophy
- **Immediate Feedback**: All status changes provide instant visual feedback
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features are available but don't clutter the basic interface
- **Error Recovery**: Failed operations provide clear retry paths
- **Accessibility**: All new functionality includes proper accessibility labels and hints

### Performance Considerations
- **Minimal UI Updates**: Only affected episodes are updated, not entire lists
- **Efficient State Management**: Status changes use immutable update patterns
- **Animation Performance**: Smooth animations for progress indicators without blocking UI

## Success Metrics Achieved

✅ **Enhanced Status Management**: Users now have comprehensive visual feedback for all episode states  
✅ **Improved Batch Operations**: Better error handling, retry options, and undo functionality  
✅ **Single-Tap Status Toggle**: Quick and intuitive episode status management  
✅ **Visual Polish**: Enhanced styling and animations for better user experience  
✅ **Test Coverage**: Additional tests covering new functionality and edge cases
