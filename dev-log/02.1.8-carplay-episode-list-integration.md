# Dev Log: Issue 02.1.8 - CarPlay Integration for Episode Lists

## Implementation Timeline

### 2025-11-01 14:20 ET - Initial Analysis and Planning

**Intent**: Understand requirements for CarPlay episode list integration and create implementation plan.

**Analysis**:
- Reviewed Issue 02.1 Scenario 8 acceptance criteria
- Examined existing episode list architecture (`EpisodeListView`, `EpisodeListViewModel`)
- Researched Apple CarPlay framework requirements
- Identified need for CarPlay scene delegate and template-based UI

**Key Findings**:
1. Existing `EpisodeListViewModel` provides solid foundation for data management
2. CarPlay uses template-based UI (`CPListTemplate`, `CPNowPlayingTemplate`)
3. Requires CarPlay entitlements and Info.plist configuration
4. Must comply with strict safety guidelines (large touch targets, minimal complexity)
5. Siri integration requires proper intent handling
6. CarPlay is primarily iPhone-based (not available on iPad)

**Decision**: Implement minimal CarPlay layer that reuses existing episode list logic while providing driver-safe UI through CarPlay templates.

**Architecture Approach**:
- Create `CarPlaySceneDelegate` for CarPlay scene lifecycle
- Implement `CarPlayEpisodeListController` to bridge episode data to CarPlay templates
- Leverage existing `EpisodeListViewModel` for data and business logic
- Use `CPListTemplate` for episode browsing
- Integrate with existing `PlaybackEngine` for playback control

**Files to Create**:
1. `/Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/CarPlaySceneDelegate.swift`
2. `/Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/CarPlayEpisodeListController.swift`
3. Update `/zpod/zpod.entitlements` with CarPlay capability
4. Update `/zpod/Info.plist` with CarPlay scene configuration

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit tests for CarPlay controller logic
- CarPlay simulator testing for UI validation
- Manual Siri integration testing

**Implementation Constraint**: CarPlay requires Apple-issued entitlements that aren't available in development environments. To work around this while building the infrastructure:
- Use conditional compilation (`#if canImport(CarPlay)`)
- Create infrastructure that's ready for CarPlay when entitlements are available
- Focus on architecture and data flow rather than full UI implementation
- Document requirements for production enablement

### 2025-11-01 14:45 ET - CarPlay Infrastructure Implementation

**Progress**: Created core CarPlay infrastructure with conditional compilation.

**Files Created**:
1. `/Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/CarPlaySceneDelegate.swift`
   - Manages CarPlay scene lifecycle
   - Sets up template hierarchy (tab bar with podcast library)
   - Handles podcast and episode list navigation
   - Uses `#if canImport(CarPlay)` for conditional compilation

2. `/Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/CarPlayEpisodeListController.swift`
   - Manages episode list template for a specific podcast
   - Formats episode metadata for CarPlay display
   - Handles episode selection and playback integration
   - Leverages existing `EpisodeRepository` and `PlaybackService`

3. `/CARPLAY_SETUP.md`
   - Comprehensive setup guide for enabling CarPlay
   - Documents entitlement and Info.plist configuration
   - Provides testing checklist and troubleshooting guide
   - Lists architecture and data flow

**Key Decisions**:
- Used conditional compilation to avoid build issues in non-iOS environments
- Did NOT modify Info.plist or entitlements to prevent CI/CD breakage
- Created infrastructure that's ready for CarPlay enablement when entitlements are available
- Documented full setup process in CARPLAY_SETUP.md

**Architecture Highlights**:
- `CarPlaySceneDelegate`: Manages CarPlay scene and root template setup
- `CarPlayEpisodeListController`: Handles episode list for individual podcasts
- Reuses existing dependencies: `EpisodeRepository`, `PlaybackService`, `EpisodeListDependencyProvider`
- Template-based UI using `CPListTemplate` for podcast/episode lists
- Episode selection triggers playback via existing `PlaybackService`

**Limitations**:
- Podcast/episode loading uses placeholder logic (needs implementation)
- Cannot test in current Linux environment (requires macOS/iOS SDK)
- Full enablement requires Apple-issued CarPlay entitlements
- Info.plist scene configuration not added to avoid build issues

### Next Steps
1. Add tests that can run without CarPlay framework
2. Create implementation documentation
3. Add integration with real podcast/episode data
4. Update PR description with setup instructions

### 2025-11-01 15:20 ET - Spec Review & Gap Analysis
**Intent**: Validate current implementation against Issue 02.1 Scenario 8 and supporting specs.

**Findings**:
- `CarPlaySceneDelegate` still returns placeholder sectionsâ€”no connection to `PodcastManaging` or actual subscribers, leaving the CarPlay library empty.
- `CarPlayEpisodeListController` stores an empty `episodes` array and never reloads; playback handler references a non-existent `PlaybackService` type and attempts `try await` on sync APIs, so the CarPlay build would fail once CarPlay frameworks are available.
- No queue management affordance is exposed; `EpisodePlaybackService` integration only fires `play` and has no `add to queue` flow.
- Voice control requirements (Siri commands, CarPlay voice templates) are untouched; no `CPVoiceControlTemplate`, synonyms, or Siri intent plumbing exists.
- Safety affordances (touch target sizing, status indicators, motion-aware restrictions) rely on CarPlay defaults but we do not annotate list items with playback status or limit/refresh counts per HIG.
- Branch lacks Info.plist/entitlement guidance in issue notes; CARPLAY_SETUP.md exists but issue narrative does not spell out remaining work for reviewers.
- Tests only assert file existence; no behavioural coverage for mapping podcasts/episodes into templates or for voice/queue logic.

**Decisions**:
- Introduce a CarPlay-specific dependency provider that reuses `PodcastManaging`, `EpisodePlaybackService`, and a lightweight queue coordinator so templates can render real data.
- Refactor CarPlay controllers to compile on iOS: replace `PlaybackService` placeholder, remove spurious `async` use, and make episode loading async with explicit completion when data arrives.
- Add voice control support via `CPVoiceControlTemplate` and state generation, plus unit tests that validate generated voice commands without importing CarPlay (using adapter types and conditional compilation).
- Extend issue documentation with explicit TODOs (podcast data wiring, queue actions, voice control, safety compliance checklist) so PR reviewers understand remaining tasks.

**Next Actions**:
1. Update issue file with detailed outstanding work list and safety/voice requirements.
2. Sketch dependency/queue design in the dev log before modifying code.
3. Refactor CarPlay controllers to consume real podcast + episode data and emit template / voice state metadata.

### 2025-11-01 15:45 ET - CarPlay Architecture Plan
**Intent**: Outline concrete implementation plan prior to coding per zPod guidelines.

**Dependency Strategy**:
- Introduce `CarPlayDependencyRegistry` (internal to LibraryFeature) with injectable dependencies: `PodcastManaging`, `EpisodePlaybackService`, and a new `CarPlayQueueManaging` coordinator.
- Provide a production default that mirrors the Episode List stack (`EnhancedEpisodePlayer`, `InMemoryPodcastManager`) while letting the host app override via `CarPlayDependencyRegistry.configure(...)` during launch.
- Back the queue with a new `CarPlayPlaybackCoordinator` that observes `EpisodePlaybackService.statePublisher` (Combine when available) to advance the queue when playback finishes.

**Data Mapping**:
- Add CarPlay-neutral adapters (`CarPlayPodcastItem`, `CarPlayEpisodeItem`) that capture display text, duration, play status, and voice command variants without importing CarPlay APIs.
- Ensure episodes are sorted by most recent `pubDate`, limited to 100 items, and annotate playback state (`played`, `in progress`, `downloaded`) for high-contrast display.

**Controller Refactors**:
- Update `CarPlaySceneDelegate` to fetch podcasts from `podcastManager.all()`, create `CPListItem`s with handlers, and configure a `CPVoiceControlTemplate` whose states map to adapter-generated voice commands.
- Update `CarPlayEpisodeListController` to accept dependencies, use adapters for `CPListItem` creation, and provide both "Play Now" and "Add to Queue" flows (the latter dispatches to `CarPlayQueueManaging.enqueue`).
- Replace erroneous `try await` and undefined `PlaybackService` usage with synchronous calls to `EpisodePlaybackService`.

**Voice Control**:
- Generate command phrases for "Play latest", "Play {podcast}", and "Play {episode}" using adapters; feed them into `CPVoiceControlState` and route selections back through delegate methods.
- Document Siri intent enablement steps in CARPLAY_SETUP.md (tying into Issue outstanding work) so QA can continue voice validation.

**Testing Plan**:
- Extend `CarPlayIntegrationTests` to validate adapter behaviour (sorting, truncation, metadata) and queue coordinator logic without importing CarPlay.
- Gate CarPlay-specific tests (`CPVoiceControlTemplate`, `CPListItem` wiring) behind `#if canImport(CarPlay)` and provide fallback assertions when absent.
- Targeted suites to run locally: `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -t LibraryFeatureTests` plus regression to guarantee no cross-package regressions.

### 2025-11-01 18:25 ET - Implementation & Verification
**Changes**:
- Added `CarPlayDependencies` + registry with configurable queue coordinator and default playback wiring; introduced `CarPlayDataAdapter` for CarPlay-neutral data shaping.
- Refactored `CarPlaySceneDelegate` to source podcasts from `PodcastManaging`, push episode templates, and annotate items with safety-aware metadata. Voice control leverages text variants rather than dedicated templates to remain compatible with current toolchain.
- Rebuilt `CarPlayEpisodeListController` to present an action sheet with "Play Now" / "Add to Queue", dispatching to the shared coordinator and logging operations for diagnostics.
- Exposed registry configuration from `ZpodApp` so the live app injects its podcast manager without taking a hard dependency on `PlaybackEngine`.
- Replaced placeholder tests with behavioural coverage for adapters and queue coordinator (`CarPlayIntegrationTests`).
- Updated `CARPLAY_SETUP.md` and issue checklist with dependency configuration guidance and remaining safety/voice follow-ups.

**Validation**:
- `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -s`
- `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh` (full regression; CarPlay packages skipped on host but all unit/integration/UI suites + lint succeed)

**Next Focus**:
- Review CarPlay UX against HIG (touch target auditing, motion restrictions).
- Wire Siri intents for "Play latest" / podcast-specific commands per spec follow-up.
