# Dev Log: Issue 02.1.8 - CarPlay Integration for Episode Lists

## Implementation Timeline

### 2025-11-01 14:20 ET - Initial Analysis and Planning

**Intent**: Understand requirements for CarPlay episode list integration and create implementation plan.

**Analysis**:
- Reviewed Issue 02.1 Scenario 8 acceptance criteria
- Examined existing episode list architecture (`EpisodeListView`, `EpisodeListViewModel`)
- Researched Apple CarPlay framework requirements
- Identified need for CarPlay scene delegate and template-based UI

**Key Findings**:
1. Existing `EpisodeListViewModel` provides solid foundation for data management
2. CarPlay uses template-based UI (`CPListTemplate`, `CPNowPlayingTemplate`)
3. Requires CarPlay entitlements and Info.plist configuration
4. Must comply with strict safety guidelines (large touch targets, minimal complexity)
5. Siri integration requires proper intent handling
6. CarPlay is primarily iPhone-based (not available on iPad)

**Decision**: Implement minimal CarPlay layer that reuses existing episode list logic while providing driver-safe UI through CarPlay templates.

**Architecture Approach**:
- Create `CarPlaySceneDelegate` for CarPlay scene lifecycle
- Implement `CarPlayEpisodeListController` to bridge episode data to CarPlay templates
- Leverage existing `EpisodeListViewModel` for data and business logic
- Use `CPListTemplate` for episode browsing
- Integrate with existing `PlaybackEngine` for playback control

**Files to Create**:
1. `/Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/CarPlaySceneDelegate.swift`
2. `/Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/CarPlayEpisodeListController.swift`
3. Update `/zpod/zpod.entitlements` with CarPlay capability
4. Update `/zpod/Info.plist` with CarPlay scene configuration

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit tests for CarPlay controller logic
- CarPlay simulator testing for UI validation
- Manual Siri integration testing

**Implementation Constraint**: CarPlay requires Apple-issued entitlements that aren't available in development environments. To work around this while building the infrastructure:
- Use conditional compilation (`#if canImport(CarPlay)`)
- Create infrastructure that's ready for CarPlay when entitlements are available
- Focus on architecture and data flow rather than full UI implementation
- Document requirements for production enablement

### 2025-11-01 14:45 ET - CarPlay Infrastructure Implementation

**Progress**: Created core CarPlay infrastructure with conditional compilation.

**Files Created**:
1. `/Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/CarPlaySceneDelegate.swift`
   - Manages CarPlay scene lifecycle
   - Sets up template hierarchy (tab bar with podcast library)
   - Handles podcast and episode list navigation
   - Uses `#if canImport(CarPlay)` for conditional compilation

2. `/Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/CarPlayEpisodeListController.swift`
   - Manages episode list template for a specific podcast
   - Formats episode metadata for CarPlay display
   - Handles episode selection and playback integration
   - Leverages existing `EpisodeRepository` and `PlaybackService`

3. `/CARPLAY_SETUP.md`
   - Comprehensive setup guide for enabling CarPlay
   - Documents entitlement and Info.plist configuration
   - Provides testing checklist and troubleshooting guide
   - Lists architecture and data flow

**Key Decisions**:
- Used conditional compilation to avoid build issues in non-iOS environments
- Did NOT modify Info.plist or entitlements to prevent CI/CD breakage
- Created infrastructure that's ready for CarPlay enablement when entitlements are available
- Documented full setup process in CARPLAY_SETUP.md

**Architecture Highlights**:
- `CarPlaySceneDelegate`: Manages CarPlay scene and root template setup
- `CarPlayEpisodeListController`: Handles episode list for individual podcasts
- Reuses existing dependencies: `EpisodeRepository`, `PlaybackService`, `EpisodeListDependencyProvider`
- Template-based UI using `CPListTemplate` for podcast/episode lists
- Episode selection triggers playback via existing `PlaybackService`

**Limitations**:
- Podcast/episode loading uses placeholder logic (needs implementation)
- Cannot test in current Linux environment (requires macOS/iOS SDK)
- Full enablement requires Apple-issued CarPlay entitlements
- Info.plist scene configuration not added to avoid build issues

### Next Steps
1. Add tests that can run without CarPlay framework
2. Create implementation documentation
3. Add integration with real podcast/episode data
4. Update PR description with setup instructions
