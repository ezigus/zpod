# 2026-01-27 — Review Fixes Implementation Plan (Issue 27.1.1.1)

**Intent**
- Apply the seven agreed review fixes for SwiftData persistence parity, test helper consolidation, and lint health.

**Plan**
1) SwiftDataPodcastRepository: add hydrate helper, error logging, and document N+1 note.
2) InMemoryPodcastManager: align update() episode upsert with production semantics.
3) TestSupport Mocks: enrich MockEpisode factory and let MockPodcast accept episodes.
4) Persistence tests: switch to shared mocks; fix hardcoded podcastID; remove duplicate helpers.
5) Document code-quality change in dev-log and rerun targeted tests.

No code changes yet; proceed with TDD using package-level tests after refactors.

## 2026-01-27 — Implementation
- Added hydrate helper + error logging in `SwiftDataPodcastRepository`; noted N+1 in class doc.
- Aligned `InMemoryPodcastManager.update` with production upsert semantics (preserve user state).
- Consolidated episode/podcast test factories into `TestSupport.Mocks`, removed local helpers in persistence tests.
- Fixed hardcoded podcastID in `EpisodeEntityTests` and reused shared mocks.
- Targeted verification: `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -t PersistenceTests,TestSupport` (pass).
