# Dev Log – Issue 03.1.5: Test Infrastructure Separation and Enhanced Reporting

## 2025-10-20 23:05 ET – Intent & Design

### Objective
Bring the run script in line with the remaining acceptance criteria by:
- Allowing each regression phase to complete even if earlier steps fail.
- Printing structured Build/Test/Overall summaries on every exit path, including interruptions.
- Capturing SIGINT/ERR to surface partial progress instead of aborting silently.

### Design Notes
- Introduce a lightweight phase runner that wraps each task (syntax, test-plan, builds, package tests, AppSmoke, Integration, UI, lint) and records success/failure without short-circuiting.
- Track phase results in associative arrays keyed by category so summary formatting can compute totals (success, warn, fail, interrupted).
- Apply `trap` handlers for `ERR` and `INT` that flip an `INTERRUPTED=1` flag, append an interruption summary item, and fall through to unified exit logic.
- Replace the existing free-form `print_summary` output with structured sections matching Issue 03.1.5 expectations.

    end
```

### Open Questions
- How granular should interrupted phases be reported (per phase vs overall)? Plan to tag incomplete phases with status `interrupted` in the summary array.
- Exit code strategy: prefer first failing phase's status while still running later phases. Will capture first non-zero exit status and return it at the end.

### Next Steps
1. Update issue status to in-progress.
2. Implement phase runner, traps, and structured summary logic in `scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh`.
3. Backfill this log with implementation notes and verification steps.

### Work Completed
- Added phase orchestration helpers (`execute_phase`, `begin_phase`) so the default regression runs every step even when a command fails, capturing the first non-zero exit code for the final status.
- Installed shared signal handling (`trap` on `INT`/`ERR`) to print partial summaries and tag the in-flight phase as interrupted rather than terminating silently.
- Rebuilt `print_summary` into structured Build/Test/Lint/Overall sections with aggregate counts and per-group breakdowns (Unit, Integration, UI, Package).
- Hardened package build/test helpers and lint invocations to detect errors without relying on `set -e`, ensuring summaries get written for both successes and failures.
- Front-loaded regression gating so syntax and AppSmoke tests execute first and halt the remaining phases on failure; mirrored the same gating in CI with a preflight job that runs syntax, clean build, and smoke before fanning out.

### Verification
- `bash -n scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh` ✅
- `bash -n scripts/lib/spm.sh` ✅
- `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh --self-check` ✅

### Follow-up
- Monitor a full default run to confirm the new summary formatting looks clean end-to-end.

## 2025-10-21 00:52 ET – CI ordering tweak
- Updated the workflow so the macOS UI/integration matrix waits for the package matrix (`needs: [preflight, package-tests]`). Packages now compile/test immediately after the preflight gate and before any UI suites fan out.
