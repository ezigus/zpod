# 03.1.1.6 Playback Ticker Follow-up

**Date**: 2025-12-27
**Goal**: Verify ticker integration, correct implementation steps, and ensure playback speed influences timeline updates.

  D --> E[emitState(.playing)]
  E --> F[PlayerFeature view models update]

  C --> G[playbackSpeed multiplier]
```

## Findings

- `EnhancedEpisodePlayer` already owns a ticker and emits periodic updates.
- The existing tick logic advances by a fixed interval and does not account for playback speed.
- The prior step list references file paths and methods that do not exist in the repo (e.g., `PlaybackTypes.swift`, `stop()`, `finish()`).

## Updates Needed

- Normalize the tick interval into a constant.
- Scale tick advancement by `playbackSpeed` so timeline reflects speed changes.
- Add a speed-focused unit test to lock in behavior.
