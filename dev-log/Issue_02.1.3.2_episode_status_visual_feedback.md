# Dev Log – Issue 02.1.3.2: Episode Status Visualisation & Progress Controls

## 2025-09-21 21:18 EDT — Kickoff & Intent
- Traceability: Issue 02.1.3.2, Specs `zpod/spec/download.md`, `zpod/spec/ui.md`, `zpod/spec/content.md` (accessibility + persistence).
- Objective: deliver live episode status UI (download + playback) during batch operations with pause/resume, quick-play resume, and completion toasts.
- Scope guardrails: focus on iPhone SwiftUI surface; reuse BatchOperationManager foundation from Issue 02.1.3.1 and keep watchOS/CarPlay shims minimal.
- Risks: bridging async progress without blocking main actor, avoiding data races when progress events arrive while view model mutates selection state, ensuring persistence stays consistent with EpisodeRepository.

## 2025-09-21 21:24 EDT — Design Blueprint (pre-implementation)
- **Download progress pipeline**: introduce `EpisodeDownloadProgress` model + `DownloadProgressProviding` protocol (Networking package) publishing `EpisodeDownloadProgressUpdate` via `AsyncStream` + Combine bridging. BatchOperationManager wires this provider and re-broadcasts progress through new `batchEpisodeProgressUpdates` publisher. EpisodeListViewModel subscribes, updating `EpisodeStatusStore` (in-memory) and re-rendering rows.
- **Pause/Resume controls**: extend `DownloadManaging` protocol with `pauseDownload`/`resumeDownload`; EpisodeListViewModel exposes `pauseEpisodeDownload`/`resumeEpisodeDownload` hitting the injected download manager. `EpisodeRowView` gains contextual button that toggles pause/resume with accessibility labels.
- **Quick-play flow**: inject `EpisodePlaybackService` into EpisodeListViewModel. `quickPlayEpisode(_:)` asks playback service to `play` with stored duration, tracks Combine publisher, and when finishing, persists `isPlayed = true` through `EpisodeRepository`. Playback progress events update `playbackPosition`.
- **Toast/banner infrastructure**: add lightweight `BannerState` struct + `EpisodeListBannerController` (Observable) living beside view model. BatchOperation completion (success/failure) raises banner with counts and optional retry/undo closures. SwiftUI overlay displays `EpisodeListBannerView` at top.
- **Persistence integration**: EpisodeListViewModel uses injected `EpisodeRepository` (default in-memory wrapper) to persist on every status mutation (download, playback, toggles). Ensure updates occur off-main via Task.detached but UI state mutated on main actor.
- **Accessibility**: each new control gets `accessibilityLabel`, `Value`, `Hint`. Dynamic Type friendly by relying on `Font.caption` or `.body` and progress bars using `.accessibilityValue("35 percent")`.

    BatchManager-->>ListVM: batchCompleted(summary)
    ListVM->>Banner: createBanner(summary)
    Banner-->>SwiftUI: show banner overlay
```

- **Undo flow**: banner's undo button calls back into view model’s enhanced `undoBatchOperation` which now records reverse actions + triggers refresh. Ensure concurrency via `Task { await ... }` on main actor.
- **Testing plan**: extend `LibraryFeatureTests` with new suites covering progress updates, pause/resume semantics, quick play completion persistence, and banner generation. Add `IntegrationTests` scenario wiring in mock download + playback services for end-to-end progress/pause interactions.

## 2025-09-21 21:52 EDT — TDD Scaffolding & Failing Specs
- Added `EpisodeStatusProgressTests` covering download progress updates, pause/resume forwarding, quick-play completion persistence, and failure banner generation.
- Introduced core scaffolding types (`EpisodeDownloadProgressUpdate`, `DownloadProgressProviding`, `EpisodeListBannerState`) to unblock compilation while keeping behaviour unimplemented so tests currently fail on unmet expectations.
- Verified via `swift test --filter EpisodeStatusProgressTests`; build halted on progress hooks (expected while wiring subscriptions) and existing macOS availability warnings — proceeding to implement feature logic.

## 2025-09-21 21:42 EDT — Progress Implementation (status UI wiring)
- Implemented `EpisodeDownloadProgressUpdate` pipeline: view model now listens to download progress provider, updates `downloadProgressByEpisodeID`, transitions episode `downloadStatus` (including new `.paused` case), and persists terminal states via `EpisodeRepository`.
- Added playback bridging: `quickPlayEpisode` subscribes to `EpisodePlaybackService.statePublisher`, updating playback position and marking episodes played on `.finished`; persisted through repository helper while keeping UI responsive.
- Surfaced batch completion banners with retry/undo closures and auto-dismiss timers; banner view wired into `EpisodeListView` with accessibility affordances.
- Refreshed `EpisodeRowView` visuals: live progress bars with pause/resume controls, quick-play button, paused iconography, and contextual messaging sourced from progress updates.
- Extended `EpisodeDownloadStatus`, filtering sort weights, and view model persistence helpers to cover new states ahead of test runs.

## 2025-09-21 21:50 EDT — Validation Attempts
- Ran `./scripts/dev-build-enhanced.sh test`; SwiftUI inspection terminated early because the helper script exits when `grep` finds no matches (see `TestResults/TestResults_20250921_2145_dev_build_enhanced_test.log`).
- Attempted `swift test --filter EpisodeStatusProgressTests` with macOS 13.0 target flags; build halted when macOS toolchain flagged `NavigationView`/UIKit-only modifiers (expected on non-iOS simulations). Captured log at `TestResults/TestResults_20250921_2145_swift_test_episode_status.log`.
- No automated suite executed successfully in this environment; manual verification pending once iOS simulator/Xcode runner is available.

## 2025-09-22 07:10 EDT — Full Xcode Validation
- Ran `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh full_build_and_test` against iPhone 16 / iOS 18.6 simulator; build + 54 test suites passed (`TestResults/TestResults_20250922_065447_test_zpod.log`, `.xcresult`).
- Confirms the updated episode status UI integrates cleanly with existing flows; no regressions surfaced in LibraryFeature or UI smoke suites.
- Next: replace mock download progress wiring with real `DownloadCoordinator` bridge so production builds reflect live updates.

## 2025-09-22 07:40 EDT — Live Download Coordinator Integration
- Added `DownloadCoordinatorBridge` (LibraryFeature) backed by Networking's `DownloadCoordinator`, broadcasting `EpisodeDownloadProgressUpdate` and handling pause/resume/cancel semantics.
- Extended `DownloadCoordinator` to emit progress/status updates for queue events and expose per-episode control helpers; LibraryFeature now depends on Networking for real download plumbing.
- Updated `EpisodeListView`/`EpisodeListViewModel` to consume the bridge and enqueue real downloads while retaining mocked fallback logic for tests.
- Re-ran `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh full_build_and_test` post-integration (`TestResults/TestResults_20250922_072444_test_zpod.log`), confirming all suites remain green.

## 2025-09-22 12:55 EDT — UITest Safeguards
- Added `UITEST_DISABLE_DOWNLOAD_COORDINATOR` escape hatch so production builds keep live progress while UI/CI suites fall back to the in-memory stub.
- Centralized `XCUIApplication` configuration to inject the environment flag across all UI test suites; updated `EpisodeListView` to honor the flag before touching `DownloadCoordinatorBridge`.
- Pending: rerun the CI workflow to confirm the crash-on-launch regressions disappear and that artifacts now capture `.xcresult` bundles for rapid diagnosis.

## 2025-09-22 15:08 EDT — UITest Stabilisation & CI Green
- Consolidated app launch across UITest suites via `launchConfiguredApp()` which waits for the main tab bar to appear before scenarios proceed.
- Confirmed `EpisodeListView` honours the `UITEST_DISABLE_DOWNLOAD_COORDINATOR` guard (debug prints visible in CI logs).
- Latest CI run (Actions run 17918843589) finished successfully with full UI + unit coverage while archiving xcresult bundles for future triage.
