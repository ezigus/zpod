# Dev Log: Issue 02.1.7 - Episode Detail Enhancement and Notes

## Issue Reference
- **Issue**: 02.1.7-episode-detail-enhancement-notes.md
- **GitHub Issue**: [#75](https://github.com/ezigus/zpod/issues/75)
- **Start Date**: 2025-11-01 01:30 ET

## Overview
Implementing Episode Detail Enhancement features including metadata display, personal notes/tags, bookmarks, ratings, and transcript access as defined in Scenario 7 of Issue 02.1.

## Implementation Log

### 2025-11-01 01:30 ET - Initial Analysis and Planning
**Intent**: Understand requirements, examine existing code, create implementation plan

**Findings**:
- Existing `EpisodeDetailView` and `EpisodeDetailViewModel` in PlayerFeature package
- `Episode` model in CoreModels already has `isBookmarked` flag and `rating` property
- `Chapter` model exists with proper structure for chapter navigation
- No existing models for:
  - Episode metadata (file size, bitrate)
  - Personal notes/tags
  - Individual bookmarks with labels/timestamps
  - Transcript data

**Current State**:
- EpisodeDetailView shows: title, description, playback controls, progress, chapters
- EpisodeDetailViewModel handles: playback state, speed control, chapter navigation

**Decisions**:
- Create new models in CoreModels package:
  - `EpisodeMetadata` for technical details
  - `EpisodeNote` for personal notes and tags
  - `EpisodeBookmark` for timestamped bookmarks
  - `EpisodeTranscript` for transcript data
- Create `EpisodeAnnotationRepository` in Persistence package
- Extend EpisodeDetailView with new sections (metadata, notes, bookmarks, rating, transcript)
- Follow existing MVVM pattern and SwiftUI conventions
- Ensure Swift 6 concurrency compliance

**Plan**:
1. Create core models in CoreModels
2. Create repository in Persistence
3. Extend EpisodeDetailViewModel
4. Enhance EpisodeDetailView with new UI sections
5. Create comprehensive tests
6. Verify all features work end-to-end

**Issues Encountered**: TBD

**Solutions Applied**: TBD

### 2025-11-01 [Time] ET - UI Enhancement
**Intent**: Add new UI sections to EpisodeDetailView

**Progress**:
- [ ] Metadata display section
- [ ] Notes editor section
- [ ] Bookmarks list section
- [ ] Rating stars component
- [ ] Transcript viewer section

**Issues Encountered**: TBD

**Solutions Applied**: TBD

### 2025-11-01 [Time] ET - Testing
**Intent**: Create comprehensive tests for new features

**Progress**:
- [ ] Unit tests for models
- [ ] Unit tests for repository
- [ ] Unit tests for ViewModel
- [ ] UI tests for metadata display
- [ ] UI tests for notes
- [ ] UI tests for bookmarks
- [ ] UI tests for rating
- [ ] UI tests for transcript

**Issues Encountered**: TBD

**Solutions Applied**: TBD

## Architecture Decisions

### Data Models
- **EpisodeMetadata**: Struct with file size, bitrate, format - companion to Episode
- **EpisodeNote**: Struct with id, episodeId, text, tags, timestamps
- **EpisodeBookmark**: Struct with id, episodeId, timestamp, label, createdDate
- **EpisodeTranscript**: Struct with segments array, each with text and timestamp range

### Storage Strategy
- Use UserDefaults for initial implementation (simple, no external dependencies)
- Design with repository pattern for easy migration to CoreData or CloudKit
- Store annotations keyed by episode ID
- Implement efficient search indexing for transcript

### UI Layout
- Collapsible sections to avoid overwhelming users
- Metadata section: grid layout showing available fields
- Notes section: expandable text editor with tag chips
- Bookmarks section: list with add button, each showing timestamp and label
- Rating section: standard 5-star component
- Transcript section: scrollable text with search bar, highlighted current position

## Testing Approach

### Unit Testing
- Test all model initializers and computed properties
- Test repository CRUD operations with mock data
- Test ViewModel annotation logic in isolation
- Verify error handling and edge cases

### UI Testing
- Test each section's visibility based on data availability
- Test note creation, editing, and deletion flow
- Test bookmark creation and navigation
- Test rating interaction
- Test transcript search and position jumping
- Verify accessibility labels and VoiceOver support

### Integration Testing
- Test persistence across app restarts
- Test concurrent modifications from multiple views
- Test performance with large transcript data
- Test bookmark navigation during active playback

## Open Questions
1. Should tags be free-form text or predefined categories?
   - **Decision**: Start with free-form, can add suggestions later
2. How to handle transcript format variations (SRT, VTT, plain text)?
   - **Decision**: Support plain text initially, add format parsers as needed
3. Should community ratings be displayed if no backend?
   - **Decision**: Show placeholder UI, fetch from future backend when available
4. Max length for notes?
   - **Decision**: 10,000 characters (reasonable for episode annotations)
