# Dev Log: Issue 02.2.2 - EpisodeListViewModel Modularization

## Date: 2025-10-29

## Context
Preflight compilation failed on Linux after the last refactor because new helpers inside `CoreModels` relied on `DateComponentsFormatter`, which is unavailable in swift-corelibs-foundation. The failure blocked `swift build` during the preflight stage.

## Investigation Notes
- Reproduced the failure locally with `swift build` and confirmed the compiler errors in `EpisodeFilterService.formatDuration` and `SmartEpisodeListRules.formatDuration`.
- Verified no other files referenced `DateComponentsFormatter` inside `CoreModels`, so the regression was limited to the reusable filtering utilities.

## Fix
- Added a cross-platform `TimeInterval.abbreviatedDescription(includeSeconds:)` helper in `CoreModels` to replace the Foundation formatter while preserving abbreviated output.
- Updated the filtering and smart list formatting helpers to call the new extension so both search snippets and smart-list summaries share the same implementation.
- Re-ran `swift build`; the run now progresses past CoreModels (confirming the formatter fix) and only fails once it reaches SwiftUI packages, which is expected in the Linux environment.

## Follow-up Validation
- Added unit coverage in `TimeIntervalFormattingTests` to lock in the abbreviated output rules, especially around edge cases like zero durations, fractional seconds, and hours-only values.
- Tweaked the helper to floor fractional seconds and skip zero-minute components when seconds are shown so the behavior matches the former `DateComponentsFormatter` results (e.g., "1h" instead of "1h 0m").
- Re-ran the CoreModels test suite to verify the helper produces the expected strings on Linux.

## Next Steps
- Monitor downstream UI formatting to make sure the abbreviated output continues to meet the acceptance criteria; adjust thresholds if tests flag regressions.
