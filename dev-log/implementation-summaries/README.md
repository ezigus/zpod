# Implementation Summaries

This directory contains comprehensive implementation summaries for completed issues. Each summary provides a detailed overview of what was implemented, design decisions, test results, and known limitations.

## Purpose

Implementation summaries serve as:
- **Reference Documentation** - Detailed explanation of how features were built
- **Design Rationale** - Why specific approaches were chosen
- **Validation Evidence** - Test results and compliance verification
- **Future Context** - Known limitations and enhancement opportunities

## Naming Convention

Files are named: `{issue-number}-{brief-description}.md`

Example: `02.1.8.1-carplay-siri-data-wiring.md`

## Contents

Each implementation summary typically includes:
1. **Overview** - High-level description of what was implemented
2. **Implementation Details** - Code changes, new files, modifications
3. **Design Decisions** - Rationale for technical choices
4. **Test Results** - Validation and test coverage
5. **Known Limitations** - Current constraints or gaps
6. **Future Enhancements** - Potential improvements

## Relationship to Dev-Logs

- **Dev-logs** (`dev-log/*.md`) - Chronological development timeline with timestamps
- **Implementation Summaries** (this directory) - Comprehensive reference documentation

Dev-logs capture the "how we got here" journey; implementation summaries document the "what we built" outcome.
