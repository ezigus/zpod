# Dev Log: Duplicate EpisodeSearchViewModel Class Fix
**Comment ID**: 3276909665  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Issue**: Fix duplicate class redeclaration and async overuse in LibraryFeature  

## Problem Statement
User reported build errors due to duplicate `EpisodeSearchViewModel` class declarations and suspected we were cycling through the same build issues. The error showed:

1. **Class redeclaration error**: Two `EpisodeSearchViewModel` classes in the same module
2. **Async overuse warnings**: Unnecessary `await` calls on synchronous methods

## Root Cause Analysis
Investigation revealed:

1. **Duplicate Classes**:
   - Original `EpisodeSearchViewModel.swift` file with advanced search functionality (commit 0cffd05)
   - Additional `EpisodeSearchViewModel` class added to `EpisodeListViewModel.swift` (commit f40b464)
   - Both classes existed in the same LibraryFeature module causing redeclaration error

2. **Async Overuse**:
   - `searchEpisodes()` and `updateSmartList()` methods are synchronous in EpisodeFilterService
   - Code was incorrectly calling them with `await` keywords

## Solution Implemented

### Phase 1: Remove Duplicate Class
- **File**: `Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/EpisodeListViewModel.swift`
- **Action**: Removed entire duplicate `EpisodeSearchViewModel` class (lines 225-321)
- **Rationale**: Keep the dedicated file with advanced functionality, remove simple duplicate

### Phase 2: Fix Async Overuse
**EpisodeListViewModel.swift** (Line 124):
```swift
// BEFORE (incorrect)
episodes = await filterService.searchEpisodes(episodes, query: searchText, filter: nil)

// AFTER (correct)
episodes = filterService.searchEpisodes(episodes, query: searchText, filter: nil)
```

**EpisodeListViewModel.swift** (Line 211):
```swift
// BEFORE (incorrect)  
let filteredEpisodes = await filterService.updateSmartList(smartList, allEpisodes: allEpisodes)

// AFTER (correct)
let filteredEpisodes = filterService.updateSmartList(smartList, allEpisodes: allEpisodes)
```

**EpisodeSearchViewModel.swift** (Line 65):
```swift
// BEFORE (incorrect)
let results = await filterService.searchEpisodes(episodes, query: searchText, filter: nil)

// AFTER (correct)
let results = filterService.searchEpisodes(episodes, query: searchText, filter: nil)
```

**EpisodeSearchViewModel.swift** (Line 95):
```swift
// BEFORE (incorrect)
let results = await filterService.searchEpisodesAdvanced(episodes, query: query, filter: nil)

// AFTER (correct)
let results = filterService.searchEpisodesAdvanced(episodes, query: query, filter: nil)
```

## Validation Results
- ✅ All syntax checks pass
- ✅ No redeclaration errors
- ✅ No async overuse warnings
- ✅ Build cycle prevention achieved

## Key Learnings
1. **Duplicate Prevention**: Always check for existing implementations before creating new classes
2. **Async Hygiene**: Verify method signatures before adding `await` - not all methods are async
3. **User Feedback**: Listen carefully to user concerns about cycling issues - they often indicate real problems

## Files Modified
1. `Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/EpisodeListViewModel.swift` - Removed duplicate class
2. `Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/EpisodeSearchViewModel.swift` - Fixed async calls
