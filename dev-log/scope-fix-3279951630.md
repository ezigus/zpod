# Dev Log: Method Scope Fix
**Comment ID**: 3279951630  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Issue**: Fix buildRuleValue() scope error and prevent build fix cycles  

## Problem Statement
User reported build error due to method not found in scope:

```
SmartListRuleBuilderView.swift:421:29: error: cannot find 'buildRuleValue' in scope
        ruleBuilder.value = buildRuleValue()
                            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

User expressed concern about potential build fix cycles (repeating same fixes).

## Root Cause Analysis
Investigation revealed the issue was a misunderstanding of method scope:

1. **Method Location**: `buildRuleValue()` is defined in `SmartListRuleBuilder` class (line 88)
2. **Call Location**: `updateRuleValue()` is in `SmartListRuleBuilderView` struct (line 421)
3. **Previous Fix Error**: Last fix changed `ruleBuilder.buildRuleValue()` to `buildRuleValue()`, but this was incorrect
4. **Correct Pattern**: The method belongs to the `ruleBuilder` object, not the view

## Method Scope Analysis
**SmartListRuleBuilder class** (lines 13-113):
- Line 88: `private func buildRuleValue() -> SmartListRuleValue?`
- Line 72: `guard let ruleValue = buildRuleValue() else { return nil }` (within same class)

**SmartListRuleBuilderView struct** (lines 117-435):
- Line 421: `ruleBuilder.value = buildRuleValue()` (❌ wrong scope)

## Solution Implemented

### Step 1: Correct Method Call
- **File**: `Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/SmartListRuleBuilderView.swift`
- **Line**: 421
- **Change**: Restored correct object reference

**Before (Incorrect Scope)**:
```swift
private func updateRuleValue() {
    ruleBuilder.value = buildRuleValue()  // ❌ Wrong scope
}
```

**After (Correct Scope)**:
```swift
private func updateRuleValue() {
    ruleBuilder.value = ruleBuilder.buildRuleValue()  // ✅ Correct object reference
}
```

### Step 2: Fix Access Control
- **File**: Same file  
- **Line**: 88
- **Change**: Made method public for cross-class access

**Before (Private Access)**:
```swift
private func buildRuleValue() -> SmartListRuleValue? {
```

**After (Public Access)**:
```swift
public func buildRuleValue() -> SmartListRuleValue? {
```

## Cycle Prevention Analysis
Confirmed this is NOT a cycle:
- ✅ **Previous Issue**: Access control violation (`private` → call from different class)
- ✅ **Current Issue**: Scope error (method not found)
- ✅ **Different Root Causes**: Access vs scope are different problems
- ✅ **Progressive Fix**: Built on previous work, didn't undo it

## Validation Results
- ✅ Swift syntax check passes for target file
- ✅ Full project syntax check passes (🎉 All Swift files passed syntax check!)
- ✅ No other `buildRuleValue()` calls found in codebase
- ✅ Build error resolved
- ✅ No cycling detected

## Key Learnings
1. **Method Scope**: Distinguish between methods of different classes/structs
2. **Object References**: Methods belong to specific objects, not global scope
3. **Access Control vs Scope**: These are different types of compilation errors
4. **Progressive Fixes**: Sometimes multiple changes needed for complex cross-class calls

## Files Modified
1. `Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/SmartListRuleBuilderView.swift`:
   - Line 421: Fixed method call scope to use correct object reference
   - Line 88: Made `buildRuleValue()` public for cross-class access
