## Implementation Log

### October 1, 2025 - 11:30 PM EDT — Initial Implementation ✅

**Objective**: Implement complete swipe gesture configuration system with haptic feedback

**Changes Made**:

1. **Phase 1: Models and Settings Infrastructure** ✅
   - Created `SwipeActionSettings.swift` in CoreModels
     - `SwipeActionType` enum with 9 available actions (play, download, mark played/unplayed, playlist, favorite, archive, delete, share)
     - Each action has displayName, systemIcon, colorTint, and isDestructive properties
     - `SwipeActionSettings` struct with leading/trailing actions, full swipe flags, and haptic preferences
     - Four preset configurations: default, playbackFocused, organizationFocused, downloadFocused
     - Action limit enforcement (max 3 actions per edge)
   - Extended `SettingsModels.swift` with `UISettings` struct
     - Includes swipeActions and hapticStyle properties
     - Fully Codable and Equatable
   - Updated `SettingsRepository` protocol and implementation
     - Added `loadGlobalUISettings()` and `saveGlobalUISettings()` methods
     - Added `.globalUI` case to `SettingsChange` enum
     - Implemented persistence in UserDefaults
   - Updated `SettingsManager`
     - Added `@Published globalUISettings` property
     - Implemented loading and change notification handling
     - Added `updateGlobalUISettings()` method

2. **Phase 2: Haptic Feedback Service** ✅
   - Created `HapticFeedbackService.swift` in SharedUtilities
     - Singleton service with UIKit UIImpactFeedbackGenerator support
     - Methods for preview, execution, success, warning, error, and selection feedback
     - Support for all SwipeHapticStyle types (light, medium, heavy, soft, rigid)
     - Graceful fallback for non-UIKit platforms

3. **Phase 3: Swipe Action Configuration UI** ✅
   - Created `SwipeActionConfigurationView.swift`
     - Form-based UI with sections for leading/trailing edge configuration
     - Add/remove actions with visual icons and color coding
     - Toggle switches for full swipe allowance per edge
     - Haptic feedback enable/disable with style picker
     - Preset loader with confirmation dialog
     - Proper accessibility identifiers for UI testing
     - Save/Cancel actions with async settings persistence

4. **Phase 4: Enhanced Swipe Actions in Episode List** ✅
   - Updated `EpisodeListView.swift`
     - Added SettingsManager dependency injection
     - Added showingSwipeConfiguration state
     - Updated toolbar with options menu (Select Episodes, Configure Swipe Actions)
     - Replaced hardcoded swipeActions with dynamic `swipeButton(for:episode:)` helper
     - Integrated haptic feedback on all swipe actions
     - Color-coded actions based on SwipeActionType.colorTint
     - Support for configurable full swipe on both edges
   - Updated `EpisodeListViewModel.swift`
     - Added `markEpisodePlayed()` and `markEpisodeUnplayed()` convenience methods
     - Added `downloadEpisode()` method for swipe-to-download
     - All methods use existing episode update infrastructure

5. **Phase 5: Testing** ✅
   - Created `SwipeActionSettingsTests.swift` (CoreModels)
     - Tests for all SwipeActionType properties
     - Tests for default and preset configurations
     - Codable conformance tests
     - Action limit enforcement tests
     - UISettings tests
   - Created `SwipeActionSettingsPersistenceTests.swift` (Persistence)
     - Tests for load/save/update operations
     - Tests for all preset configurations
     - Haptic style persistence tests
     - Change notification tests (Combine)
     - Edge case tests (empty lists, max actions, corrupted data)

**Technical Decisions**:

1. **Action Limits**: Enforced maximum of 3 actions per swipe edge to prevent UI overcrowding
2. **Haptic Integration**: Created separate service for reusability across the app
3. **Preset Configurations**: Provided four workflow-focused presets to help users get started
4. **Color Coding**: Used platform-agnostic color enum to maintain consistency
5. **Settings Architecture**: Extended existing settings infrastructure for consistency
6. **Dependency Injection**: Made SettingsManager optional in EpisodeListView init for backward compatibility

**Accessibility Considerations**:

1. All swipe actions have corresponding batch operation alternatives
2. Configuration UI includes descriptive labels and identifiers
3. Haptic feedback is optional and can be disabled
4. Visual confirmation through color-coded buttons
5. Full swipe actions provide immediate feedback
6. Actions remain discoverable through alternative navigation

**Known Limitations**:

1. Playlist addition action is a placeholder (will be implemented in future issue)
2. Share action is a placeholder (will be implemented in future issue)
3. UI tests for actual swipe gestures are not included (XCTest has limited gesture support)
4. Partial swipe preview visual indicators not implemented (SwiftUI limitation)

**Testing Status**:
- ✅ Syntax validation passed (165 files)
- ✅ Unit tests created and compile successfully
- ✅ Integration tests created and compile successfully
- ⚠️  Full test execution skipped (requires Xcode environment)

**Files Created**:
- `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/SwipeActionSettings.swift`
- `Packages/SharedUtilities/Sources/SharedUtilities/HapticFeedbackService.swift`
- `Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/SwipeActionConfigurationView.swift`
- `Packages/CoreModels/Tests/CoreModelsTests/SwipeActionSettingsTests.swift`
- `Packages/Persistence/Tests/PersistenceTests/SwipeActionSettingsPersistenceTests.swift`

**Files Modified**:
- `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/SettingsModels.swift`
- `Packages/Persistence/Sources/Persistence/SettingsRepository.swift`
- `Packages/SettingsDomain/Sources/SettingsDomain/SettingsManager.swift`
- `Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/EpisodeListView.swift`
- `Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/EpisodeListViewModel.swift`

**Verification Steps**:
1. Launch app and navigate to any episode list
2. Tap options menu (ellipsis icon) → "Configure Swipe Actions"
3. Add/remove actions for left and right swipes
4. Test full swipe toggles
5. Change haptic feedback settings
6. Load preset configurations
7. Save settings
8. Verify swipe gestures work with configured actions
9. Confirm haptic feedback occurs on swipe actions
10. Verify actions execute correctly (mark played, favorite, etc.)

## Acceptance Criteria Status

From Issue 02.1 Scenario 6:

- [x] **Customizable quick actions** - Users can configure play, download, mark played, add to playlist, favorite, archive, delete, share
- [x] **Configure left vs right swipes** - Independent configuration for leading and trailing edges
- [x] **Haptic feedback** - Implemented with configurable intensity styles
- [x] **Visual confirmation** - Color-coded actions with system icons
- [x] **Partial/full swipe support** - Full swipe execution enabled via settings per edge
- [x] **Accessibility alternatives** - All actions available through batch operations menu

## Next Steps

1. Add UI tests for swipe configuration view interaction
2. Implement playlist action when playlist feature is ready
3. Implement share action when sharing feature is ready
4. Consider adding partial swipe preview animations if SwiftUI APIs improve
5. Monitor user feedback on preset configurations
6. Consider adding custom action ordering within each edge

## Performance Notes

- Settings load asynchronously on EpisodeListView init
- Haptic feedback generators are created per interaction (not cached)
- Settings changes propagate via Combine publishers
- All swipe action logic is main-thread safe
