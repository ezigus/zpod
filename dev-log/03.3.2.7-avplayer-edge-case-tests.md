# 03.3.2.7 - AVPlayer Edge-Case Spec Coverage Tests

**Date**: 2026-01-06 07:30 EST  
**Issue**: #03.3.2.7 (GitHub #311)  
**Status**: Proposed  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

## Intent

Document and track missing spec-aligned AVPlayer test coverage for playback error handling, interruptions, and speed changes. This is scoped to UI/integration tests that map directly to `zpod/spec/playback.md`.

## Notes

- Created issue file `Issues/03.3.2.7-avplayer-edge-case-tests.md` and GitHub issue #311.
- Out-of-spec candidates recorded (completion state, seek-beyond-end clamping, rapid seek bursts) to avoid accidental scope creep.

## Next Steps (When Scheduled)

1. Add UI tests for playback error handling once 03.3.4 error UI is available.
2. Add interruption handling coverage (debug-only hook if system simulation is unreliable).
3. Add playback speed change coverage once 03.1.2 speed controls ship.
