# Dev Log - Issue 02.1.6.4: Swipe Configuration Preset Automation

## Context
- **Issue**: 02.1.6.4
- **Parent Issue**: 02.1.6 — Swipe Gestures and Quick Actions
- **Spec Reference**: `Issues/02.1.6.4-swipe-configuration-preset-automation.md`

## Intent

### October 10, 2025 - 12:13 PM EDT — Kickoff & Diagnostic Plan

**Objective**: Restore UITest coverage for swipe presets by confirming persisted state survives relaunch and making the preset controls fully automatable.

- Review existing UITest artifacts (`TestResults/TestResults_20251006_123242_test_zpodUITests-SwipeConfigurationUITests.log` and latest runs) to pinpoint where the UI stops mutating state and whether relaunch resets configuration.
- Instrument `SwipeConfigurationController` and related views with structured logging (temporary `Logger.swipeConfigurationUITest`) to capture edge assignments, full-swipe flags, and baseline resets during tests.
- Validate that `restoreDefaultConfiguration()` flushes to persistence before sheet dismissal; add view-model assertions if UI automation remains flaky.
- Decide between launch argument resets or explicit test harness helpers for deterministic starting state before each scenario.

**Next Steps**:
1. Audit failing UITest to capture actual controller state before/after relaunch, documenting findings in this log and the spec.
2. Adjust the swipe configuration UI so preset buttons and toggles respond reliably under XCTest (prefer standard SwiftUI controls over coordinate workarounds).
3. Once interactions stabilize, re-run `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -t SwipeConfigurationUITests` and update `TestSummary.md` with coverage notes and remaining risks.
