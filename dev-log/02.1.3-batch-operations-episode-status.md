## Implementation Date
December 11, 2024 - 10:00 PM EST

## Overview
Implementing comprehensive batch operations for episode management with multi-selection interface, visual progress indicators, and advanced episode status tracking.

## Approach

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Completed)
1. **Batch Operation Models** - Created comprehensive data models in `BatchOperationModels.swift`:
   - `BatchOperationType` enum with 11 operation types (download, mark played/unplayed, playlist, etc.)
   - `BatchOperation` struct for tracking batch operations with progress
   - `EpisodeOperation` struct for individual episode operations
   - `EpisodeSelectionState` for managing multi-selection state
   - `EpisodeSelectionCriteria` for advanced criteria-based selection

2. **Batch Operation Manager** - Implemented service layer in `BatchOperationManager.swift`:
   - `BatchOperationManaging` protocol for dependency injection
   - `BatchOperationManager` with async execution and progress tracking
   - Real-time progress updates via Combine publishers
   - Operation cancellation and error handling
   - `InMemoryBatchOperationManager` for testing

3. **Enhanced View Model** - Extended `EpisodeListViewModel.swift`:
   - Multi-selection state management
   - Batch operation execution methods
   - Selection helpers (select all, none, invert, criteria-based)
   - Integration with batch operation manager

### Phase 2: User Interface (Completed)
1. **Multi-Selection UI** - Updated `EpisodeListView.swift`:
   - Multi-select toolbar with selection count and controls
   - Batch operation progress indicators
   - Quick action buttons for common operations
   - Selection state preservation during scrolling

2. **Enhanced Episode Rows** - Updated episode display components:
   - Selection checkboxes in multi-select mode
   - Visual selection feedback (blue tint, borders)
   - Progress indicators for downloads and playback
   - Long-press gesture to enter multi-select mode

3. **Batch Operation Views** - Created `BatchOperationViews.swift`:
   - `BatchOperationView` for operation selection
   - `BatchOperationProgressView` for real-time progress
   - `EpisodeSelectionCriteriaView` for advanced selection
   - `PlaylistSelectionView` for playlist operations

### Phase 3: Testing (Completed)
1. **Unit Tests** - Created `BatchOperationTests.swift`:
   - Batch operation creation and execution
   - Selection state management
   - Progress tracking and cancellation
   - Criteria-based episode matching
   - Performance testing for large batches (100 episodes)

2. **UI Tests** - Created `BatchOperationUITests.swift`:
   - Multi-selection interface interactions
   - Batch operation execution flows
   - Progress indicator visibility
   - Advanced selection features
   - Gesture-based interactions

## Key Features Implemented

### Multi-Selection Interface
- ✅ Enter/exit multi-select mode with toolbar button
- ✅ Selection checkboxes with visual feedback
- ✅ Long-press gesture to start selection
- ✅ Select all/none/invert functionality
- ✅ Selection count display

### Batch Operations
- ✅ 11 operation types: download, mark played/unplayed, favorite, bookmark, archive, delete, share, playlist
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking with cancellation
- ✅ Error handling with retry capabilities
- ✅ Undo functionality for reversible operations
- ✅ Operation queue management

### Advanced Selection
- ✅ Criteria-based selection by date, status, duration
- ✅ Play status filtering (played/unplayed/in-progress)
- ✅ Download status filtering
- ✅ Date range selection (older/newer than X days)
- ✅ Favorite/bookmark/archive status filtering

### Visual Feedback
- ✅ Enhanced status indicators for all episode states
- ✅ Download progress bars with pause/resume controls
- ✅ Playback progress indicators
- ✅ Operation progress with detailed feedback
- ✅ Selection state preservation during scrolling

## Technical Implementation Details

### Swift 6 Concurrency
- All batch operations use `async/await` patterns
- `@MainActor` isolation for UI components
- `Sendable` conformance for data models
- Thread-safe progress updates via Combine

### Architecture
- Protocol-based dependency injection
- MVVM pattern with reactive updates
- Separation of concerns between models, services, and UI
- Testable design with mock implementations

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient batch processing with configurable delays
- Progress streaming to avoid UI blocking
- Memory-efficient large selection handling
- Background operation management

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Test Coverage
- ✅ Batch operation logic and state management
- ✅ Selection state transitions and validation
- ✅ Progress calculation and status updates
- ✅ Criteria matching algorithms
- ✅ Performance testing (100 episodes in <30 seconds)

### UI Test Coverage
- ✅ Multi-selection interface interactions
- ✅ Batch operation execution flows
- ✅ Visual feedback and progress indicators
- ✅ Gesture recognition and accessibility
- ✅ Error scenarios and edge cases

## Acceptance Criteria Status

- [x] Progress indicators and error handling
- [x] Criteria-based selection support

### Scenario 2: Episode Status and Progress Management ✅
- [x] Clear status indicators with appropriate icons
- [x] Single tap mark as played/unplayed
- [x] Download progress with pause/resume controls
- [x] Playback progress bars for partially played episodes

### Scenario 3: Advanced Selection and Bulk Management ✅
- [x] Criteria-based selection (date, status, duration)
- [x] Invert selection and select all/none
- [x] Selection state preservation during scrolling/filtering
