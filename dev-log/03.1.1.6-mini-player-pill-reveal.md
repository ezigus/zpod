# Dev Log: Issue 03.1.1.6 – Mini-Player Pill Reveal + Player Tab Full Player

## 2026-01-01 16:10 ET – Intent & Design Notes

**Intent**: Move the mini-player to a collapsed, always-available pill handle and replace the Player tab’s simplified player UI with the full player view. This reduces persistent height while keeping playback controls discoverable and consistent.

**Design Notes**:
- Pill handle is always visible, even when nothing is playing.
- Swipe up or tap on the pill expands the mini-player; swipe down or "Hide mini-player" collapses it.
- Mini-player expansion is independent of playback state (playback can continue while collapsed).
- Full player is a single UI surface: shown as a sheet from the mini-player and embedded in the Player tab.
- Empty state is required in the full player (and mini-player expansion) when no episode is active; use a neutral visual treatment.
- Safe-area spacing must keep pill/mini-player above the tab bar without blocking tab taps.
- Expanded mini-player increases the bottom inset so content is pushed up.

```

  A --> E[Expanded Mini-Player (overlay above tab bar)]

```

**Decisions**:
- Expanded mini-player increases bottom inset (content is pushed up).
- Empty/idle presentation should be visually neutral.
