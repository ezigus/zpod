# Dev Log - Issue 02.1.6.3: Modular Swipe Configuration Settings Refactor

## Context
- **Issue**: 02.1.6.3
- **Parent Issue**: 02.1.6 — Swipe Gestures and Quick Actions
- **Spec Reference**: `Issues/02.1.6.3-swipe-configuration-settings-refactor.md`

## Intent

### October 06, 2025 - 01:18 PM EDT — Coverage Expansion Planning

**Objective**: Define test expansions to validate preset iteration, action caps, and registry-driven controller factories before implementation.

- Unit scope: extend `SwipeConfigurationControllerTests` with scenarios covering `applyPreset(_:)` across non-default presets (ensuring arrays match expected ordering) and `addAction(_:edge:)` enforcement of the three-action limit per edge.
- UI automation: introduce a new test exercising each preset in sequence, verifying debug summary updates and ensuring Save enables for every preset. Add assertions that menu additions respect the three-action cap (no new buttons once limit reached) and include cleanup via restore defaults.
- Helpers: update UITest utilities to expose reusable assertions for debug state fragments (leading/trailing arrays, full swipe flags) instead of ad-hoc checks per test.
- Risks: additional UI test runtime (~+60s) — monitor for timeouts and reuse existing waiters. Ensure new controller tests remain mac-compatible if/when SwiftPM support is enabled.

**Next Steps**:
1. Add controller test cases first to capture expected preset/action behaviours.
2. Expand UITest suite with a dedicated `testSwipeConfigurationPresetsCycle` (or equivalent) using new helpers for debug state validation.
3. Re-run targeted UI suite; capture runtime impact and document in TestSummary if notable.


### October 06, 2025 - 01:17 PM EDT — Registry Wiring & Settings Manager Integration

**Objective**: Instantiate the feature configuration registry inside `SettingsManager`, register the swipe configuration feature, and expose controller/service factories for downstream consumers.

- Added `SwipeConfigurationFeature` in SettingsDomain so the registry can vend a descriptor and controller backed by the shared `SwipeConfigurationService`.
- Extended `SettingsManager` with a stored swipe configuration service, public registry handle, and `makeSwipeConfigurationController()` helper that bootstraps with current `globalUISettings`.
- Updated `EpisodeListDependencyProvider` to source the swipe service from a `SettingsManager` instance, keeping episode list sheets and future settings surfaces on the same persistence pipeline.
- Authored `SettingsManagerFeatureRegistryTests` covering descriptor enumeration, controller instantiation, and the manager factory helper (new macOS target not yet enabled due to Persistence package availability).
- Re-ran `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -t SwipeConfigurationUITests` → ✅ (`TestResults/TestResults_20251006_131225_test_zpodUITests-SwipeConfigurationUITests.log`). Direct `swift test` for SettingsDomain still blocked by macOS availability gaps in Persistence; captured as a follow-up risk.

**Next Steps**:
1. Add lightweight wrapper(s) so the forthcoming settings shell can request SwiftUI views from feature descriptors without depending on LibraryFeature directly.
2. Expand UITest permutations to iterate all presets and assert three-action cap enforcement alongside registry-driven controller injection.


### October 06, 2025 - 01:04 PM EDT — Registry Integration Design Kickoff

**Objective**: Plan how to host the new `FeatureConfigurationRegistry` inside the settings shell, surface the swipe feature via the registry, and outline coverage expansion for controller + UI automation.

- Inventory existing settings entry points (`Packages/SettingsDomain/Sources/SettingsDomain/SettingsManager.swift`, app-level navigation to settings, and any SwiftUI shells) to determine where the registry should live. Target: centralize in `SettingsManager` (as owner of configuration services) while exposing `@MainActor` accessors for UI composition.
- Define `SwipeConfigurationFeature` type that conforms to `ConfigurableFeature`, initializes `SwipeConfigurationController` with `SwipeConfigurationService`, and builds the SwiftUI configuration view. Ensure the view factory is @MainActor and composes the existing `SwipeActionConfigurationView` without duplicating state.
- Decide injection story: registry seeded either via `EpisodeListDependencyProvider` or a new `SettingsDependencyProvider`. Prefer `SettingsManager.makeRegistry()` factory to keep wiring testable; document this path in the issue file.
- Testing plan:
  1. Add unit coverage validating registry returns the swipe descriptor when feature is available and that controller factory yields a configured controller with bootstrapped baseline.
  2. Extend UITest to open future settings host once available; near-term, add controller unit tests for preset iteration + full-swipe cap, and update UI automation to iterate presets + enforce cap toggles.
- Risk checklist:
  - Avoid cross-actor violations: registry operations must remain async/await friendly; ensure the registry doesn’t capture view instances outside the main actor.
  - Maintain compatibility with existing `SettingsManager.updateGlobalUISettings`; plan depreciation notes but keep API functioning.
- Exit criteria for this phase:
  - Registry instantiation path agreed and documented.
  - Swipe feature registration API sketched (including dependency injection + preview/test scaffolding).
  - UITest enhancements scoped with concrete helper APIs to avoid brittle coordinate taps.

**Next Actions**:
1. Update Issue 02.1.6.3 objectives/acceptance criteria with registry wiring notes (already captured via issue edit; verify alignment).
2. Draft `SwipeConfigurationFeature` skeleton in SettingsDomain (tests first) and wire registry creation to place the feature into the settings shell.
3. Define additional UITest assertions covering preset rotation and action cap enforcement.
