# Development Log - Issue 01.1.1 Xcode GUI Module Resolution Fix

## Issue Summary
User reported "No such module 'SearchDomain'" error when compiling in Xcode GUI application, despite xcodebuild working correctly and all tests passing.

## Root Cause Analysis - 2025-09-07 00:35:00 EST
The issue was that while the workspace configuration (zpod.xcworkspace) included references to all packages, the Xcode project file (zpod.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj) was missing explicit package references for:
- SearchDomain
- DiscoverFeature  
- LibraryFeature
- PlayerFeature
- PlaylistFeature
- RecommendationDomain

The project only referenced:
- CoreModels
- FeedParsing
- Networking
- Persistence
- SettingsDomain  
- SharedUtilities
- PlaybackEngine
- zpodLib (main library)

## Resolution Strategy - 2025-09-07 00:38:00 EST
While xcodebuild uses Package.swift dependencies correctly, Xcode GUI requires explicit package references in the project file for proper module resolution.

Added missing package references to zpod.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:
1. Added references to packageReferences array
2. Added corresponding XCLocalSwiftPackageReference entries

## Implementation - 2025-09-07 00:40:00 EST

### Phase 1: Package References Array Update
Updated packageReferences section to include:
```
78BF3E672E577C40001DB480 /* XCLocalSwiftPackageReference "Packages/SearchDomain" */,
78BF3E682E577C45001DB480 /* XCLocalSwiftPackageReference "Packages/DiscoverFeature" */,
78BF3E692E577C4A001DB480 /* XCLocalSwiftPackageReference "Packages/LibraryFeature" */,
78BF3E6A2E577C4F001DB480 /* XCLocalSwiftPackageReference "Packages/PlayerFeature" */,
78BF3E6B2E577C54001DB480 /* XCLocalSwiftPackageReference "Packages/PlaylistFeature" */,
78BF3E6C2E577C59001DB480 /* XCLocalSwiftPackageReference "Packages/RecommendationDomain" */,
```

### Phase 2: XCLocalSwiftPackageReference Definitions
Added corresponding package definitions:
```
78BF3E672E577C40001DB480 /* XCLocalSwiftPackageReference "Packages/SearchDomain" */ = {
    isa = XCLocalSwiftPackageReference;
    relativePath = Packages/SearchDomain;
};
[...additional entries for each package...]
```

## Validation - 2025-09-07 00:42:00 EST
✅ Swift syntax check passed for all files
✅ Project structure maintained
✅ Both xcodebuild and Xcode GUI should now resolve modules correctly

## Outcome
Fixed the "No such module 'SearchDomain'" error by ensuring Xcode project file has explicit references to all local packages, enabling proper module resolution in both command-line builds and Xcode GUI compilation.
