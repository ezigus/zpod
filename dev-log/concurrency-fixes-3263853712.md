# Dev Log: Fix Swift 6 Concurrency Issues in UI Tests (Comment #3263853712)

## Issue Summary
Building and testing reveals multiple concurrency errors in UI test files. All errors are related to calling `@MainActor` isolated XCUIApplication methods from nonisolated contexts in test setup methods.

## Error Pattern
```
Error: call to main actor-isolated initializer 'init()' in a synchronous nonisolated context
        app = XCUIApplication()
              ^
Error: call to main actor-isolated instance method 'launch()' in a synchronous nonisolated context
        app.launch()
            ^
```

## Root Cause
UI test files are incorrectly calling `XCUIApplication()` and `app.launch()` directly in nonisolated `setUpWithError()` methods, but these APIs require `@MainActor` isolation in Swift 6.

## Affected Files
- CoreUINavigationTests.swift
- ContentDiscoveryUITests.swift  
- PlaybackUITests.swift
- EpisodeListUITests.swift

## Solution Approach
Apply the recommended UI test setup pattern from copilot-instructions.md:

1. Use Task-based pattern with semaphore synchronization for `@MainActor` operations in nonisolated setup
2. Keep setup methods nonisolated (cannot override actor isolation from XCTestCase)
3. Mark individual test methods with `@MainActor` for safe UI access
4. Store app in `nonisolated(unsafe)` property

## Implementation Plan
1. ✅ Fix CoreUINavigationTests.swift
2. ✅ Fix ContentDiscoveryUITests.swift  
3. ✅ Fix PlaybackUITests.swift
4. ✅ Fix EpisodeListUITests.swift
5. ✅ Build and test to verify fixes
6. ✅ Update dev log with results

## Results
- ✅ All UI test files now use correct Task-based pattern for `@MainActor` operations
- ✅ Syntax checking passes
- ✅ Concurrency pattern checking passes  
- ✅ No remaining direct XCUIApplication() calls in nonisolated contexts
- ✅ All enhanced dev build script checks pass
