# Dev Log: Fix EpisodeSearchManager Repository Access Control Issue
**Comment ID**: 3276938542  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Issue**: Fix private repository access in EpisodeSearchViewModel  

## Problem Statement
User reported build error where `EpisodeSearchViewModel` was trying to directly access the private `repository` property of `EpisodeSearchManager`:

```
Error: 'repository' is inaccessible due to 'private' protection level
try? await searchManager.repository.incrementSuggestionFrequency(for: suggestion.text)
```

User also expressed concern about potential cycling through build issues.

## Root Cause Analysis
Investigation revealed:

1. **Access Control Violation**:
   - `EpisodeSearchManager.repository` property is correctly marked `private` for encapsulation
   - `EpisodeSearchViewModel.selectSuggestion()` was trying to access it directly
   - This violates proper object-oriented design principles

2. **Missing Public API**:
   - `EpisodeSearchManager` had no public method to expose `incrementSuggestionFrequency` functionality
   - The existing `saveSearch()` method calls it internally, but semantically represents search history saving, not just frequency tracking

## Solution Implemented

### Phase 1: Add Public API Method
**File**: `Packages/Persistence/Sources/Persistence/EpisodeSearchRepository.swift`
**Action**: Added public method to `EpisodeSearchManager` class:

```swift
/// Increment suggestion frequency for a given text
public func incrementSuggestionFrequency(for text: String) {
    Task {
        try? await repository.incrementSuggestionFrequency(for: text)
    }
}
```

### Phase 2: Update Client Code
**File**: `Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/EpisodeSearchViewModel.swift`
**Action**: Updated line 162 to use the public API:

```swift
// BEFORE (incorrect - private access)
Task {
    try? await searchManager.repository.incrementSuggestionFrequency(for: suggestion.text)
}

// AFTER (correct - public API)
searchManager.incrementSuggestionFrequency(for: suggestion.text)
```

## Design Benefits
1. **Proper Encapsulation**: Repository remains private, maintaining clean architecture
2. **Clear Public API**: Dedicated method for frequency tracking vs. search history saving
3. **Simplified Usage**: No need for manual Task creation in client code
4. **Non-Cyclic Fix**: This is a new issue, not a repeat of previous fixes

## Validation Results
- ✅ All syntax checks pass
- ✅ No access control violations
- ✅ Proper object-oriented design maintained
- ✅ No build cycles detected

## Key Learnings
1. **Encapsulation**: Always provide public APIs instead of exposing internal dependencies
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Different operations should have different methods even if they share implementation
3. **User Feedback**: Legitimate concern about cycles - always check dev-log history before fixing

## Files Modified
1. `Packages/Persistence/Sources/Persistence/EpisodeSearchRepository.swift` - Added public method
2. `Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/EpisodeSearchViewModel.swift` - Fixed access pattern
