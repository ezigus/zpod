# Dev Log: Issue 02.2.3 - DefaultEpisodeFilterService Slimming

## Issue
DefaultEpisodeFilterService was a 700+ line monolithic actor with a `// swiftlint:disable type_body_length` suppression, making it difficult to maintain and test. The goal was to decompose it into smaller, composable, Sendable collaborators while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Implementation Approach

### Architecture Decision
Instead of splitting the actor into multiple actors (which would complicate isolation), I extracted the business logic into **Sendable value types (structs)** that can be safely called across actor boundaries. This approach:
- Avoids actor isolation complexity
- Allows `nonisolated` methods in DefaultEpisodeFilterService
- Makes helpers independently testable
- Maintains thread-safety through immutability

### Helper Services Created

1. **EpisodeSortService** (86 lines)
   - Handles all episode sorting logic
   - Implements all `EpisodeSortBy` cases
   - Contains helper methods for status value calculations
   - Pure functions with no state

2. **EpisodeFilterEvaluator** (64 lines)
   - Evaluates filter conditions against episodes
   - Applies filter logic (AND/OR)
   - Handles archived episode exclusion
   - Stateless evaluation logic

3. **EpisodeSearchHelper** (55 lines)
   - Basic text search matching
   - Title and description searching
   - Integrates with filter and sort services
   - Minimal, focused responsibility

4. **AdvancedSearchEvaluator** (258 lines)
   - Advanced search with scoring and highlighting
   - Boolean operator support (AND/OR/NOT)
   - Field-specific search (title, description, podcast, etc.)
   - Context snippet generation
   - Most complex helper but still well-scoped

5. **SmartListRuleEvaluator** (211 lines)
   - Evaluates smart list rules
   - Supports all rule types (playStatus, downloadStatus, dates, numbers, strings, booleans)
   - Handles nested rule logic
   - Comparison operators (equals, contains, before, after, etc.)

### Refactored DefaultEpisodeFilterService (147 lines)
- Maintains the same public API
- Delegates to helper services
- Private helper instances (all Sendable)
- All methods remain `nonisolated` for easy consumption
- **No SwiftLint suppression needed!**

## Results

### Line Count Reduction
- **Before**: 700 lines (exceeding 500-line warning threshold)
- **After**: 147 lines (71% below threshold!)
- **Total code**: ~820 lines across 6 files (better organized)

### File Structure
```
CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/
├── EpisodeFilterService.swift (147 lines) - Protocol + DefaultImplementation
├── EpisodeSortService.swift (86 lines)
├── EpisodeFilterEvaluator.swift (64 lines)
├── EpisodeSearchHelper.swift (55 lines)
├── AdvancedSearchEvaluator.swift (258 lines)
└── SmartListRuleEvaluator.swift (211 lines)
```

### Testing
- Added `EpisodeSortServiceTests` (7 tests covering all sort criteria)
- Added `EpisodeFilterEvaluatorTests` (9 tests covering conditions, negation, AND/OR logic)
- All 254 CoreModelsTests pass
- Existing consumers (LibraryFeature, SmartEpisodeListViewModel) unaffected

### Bonus Fixes
Fixed cross-platform compatibility issue in `SmartEpisodeListRules.swift`:
- Replaced `DateComponentsFormatter` (unavailable in swift-corelibs-foundation)
- Used existing `TimeInterval.abbreviatedDescription()` extension instead

## Concurrency Safety

All helpers are:
- `Sendable` structs (value types)
- Immutable (no mutable state)
- Safe to use across actor boundaries
- Can be stored in actors as `let` properties

DefaultEpisodeFilterService remains an actor but all methods are `nonisolated` because they delegate to stateless helpers.

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Zero API changes**
- EpisodeFilterService protocol unchanged
- DefaultEpisodeFilterService public API identical
- All consumers continue to work without modification
- Dependency injection still supported (protocol-based)

## Future Considerations

1. **Additional Tests**: Could add tests for AdvancedSearchEvaluator and SmartListRuleEvaluator
2. **Performance**: Helpers are value types, so there's minimal overhead
3. **Maintenance**: Each helper is now independently testable and modifiable
4. **Documentation**: Could add more inline comments for complex search scoring logic

## Lessons Learned

1. **Value types over actors for stateless logic**: When the logic doesn't need to maintain state, Sendable structs are simpler than actors
2. **Composition over inheritance**: Breaking monoliths into focused helpers improves testability
3. **Keep the public API stable**: Internal refactoring shouldn't break consumers
4. **Test incrementally**: Adding tests for each helper during extraction catches issues early
