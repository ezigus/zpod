# Dev Log: Issue 12 - Recommendations Engine (Baseline Heuristics)

## Design Approach (2024-12-19 EST)

### Problem Statement
- Implement RecommendationService protocol with baseline heuristics
- Input: play history, subscription list
- Output: recommended podcasts + episodes with reason strings
- Heuristics: recently played categories frequency + unplayed episodes recency + popularity placeholder

### Architecture Plan

```mermaid

    A[RecommendationService Protocol] --> B[BaselineRecommendationService]
    B --> C[CategoryFrequencyAnalyzer]
    B --> D[EpisodeRecencyAnalyzer] 
    B --> E[PopularityScorer]
    
    F[RecommendationModels] --> G[Recommendation]
    F --> H[RecommendationReason]
    F --> I[RecommendationCriteria]
    
    B --> F
    
    J[PodcastManaging] --> B
    K[PlaybackHistory] --> B
    L[EpisodeStateManager] --> B
```

### Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1: Core Models** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Created recommendation data models in CoreModels/RecommendationModels.swift
   - Added to existing CoreModels package following established patterns
   - Models: Recommendation, RecommendationReason, RecommendationCriteria, PlaybackHistoryEntry
   - Added RecommendationService protocol definition

2. **Phase 2: Service Package & Implementation** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Created RecommendationDomain package following existing package structure
   - Implemented BaselineRecommendationService with all required heuristics
   - Category frequency analysis with 30-day weighting for recent plays
   - Recency scoring using exponential decay function (30-day half-life)
   - Popularity placeholder scoring (static 0.5 for now)
   - Proper filtering of played episodes when configured

3. **Phase 3: Unit Tests** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Comprehensive test suite with 8 test cases covering all acceptance criteria
   - testAcceptanceCriteria1_CategoryWeighting: verifies higher frequency categories get more recommendations
   - testAcceptanceCriteria2_ExcludePlayedEpisodes: confirms played episodes are excluded when configured
   - testAcceptanceCriteria3_RecencyPreference: validates newer episodes score higher
   - testAcceptanceCriteria4_ReasonStringGeneration: ensures meaningful reason strings
   - Edge case tests: empty history, no podcasts, all episodes played
   - testDeterministicOrdering_SameInputsSameOutput: verifies consistent results
   - All tests pass ✅

4. **Phase 4: Integration** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Added RecommendationDomain to main Package.swift
   - Build and compilation successful
   - No breaking changes to existing code

### Implementation Details

#### Scoring Algorithm Implementation:
1. **Category Frequency Score:**
   - Counts plays by category with 2x weight for plays within last 30 days
   - Normalizes to percentage of total weighted plays
   - Returns highest category score for podcasts with multiple categories

2. **Recency Score:**
   - Uses exponential decay: score = e^(-days_since_publication/30)
   - Gives high scores to very recent episodes, gradually decreasing
   - Episodes without publication dates get score of 0

3. **Combined Score:**
   - Weighted sum: (category * 0.5) + (recency * 0.3) + (popularity * 0.2)
   - Configurable weights via RecommendationCriteria
   - Deterministic sorting by score descending

#### Reason String Generation:
- Primary message: "Recommended for you"
- Details include: category matches, "recent episode" for episodes < 7 days old
- Category weights included for transparency
- User-friendly display text combining primary + details

### Test Results Summary
```
Test Suite 'BaselineRecommendationServiceTests' passed
Executed 8 tests, with 0 failures (0 unexpected) in 0.003 seconds
```

All acceptance criteria successfully implemented:
✅ Category weighting with frequency analysis
✅ Exclusion of played episodes 
✅ Recency preference for newer episodes
✅ Deterministic ordering by score
✅ Meaningful reason strings for UI
✅ Edge case handling

### Magic Number Extraction Updates (2025-08-30 00:10 EST)

#### Additional Code Quality Improvements
Following code review feedback, two additional magic numbers identified:

1. **Category Relevance Threshold (0.1)** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Extracted to `categoryRelevanceThreshold` constant with documentation
   - Used for determining relevant categories based on user listening patterns
   - Location: BaselineRecommendationService.swift

2. **Popularity Score Placeholder (0.5)** - TO BE ADDRESSED
   - Currently hardcoded in calculateRecommendationScore method
   - Should be extracted as named constant or made configurable
   - Location: BaselineRecommendationService.swift line 140

3. **Test Date Consistency** - TO BE ADDRESSED
   - testDate variable declared but never used in tests
   - Should use fixed dates for deterministic testing or remove unused variable
   - Location: BaselineRecommendationServiceTests.swift line 12

#### Implementation Log - Additional Fixes (2025-12-19 EST)

**Phase 1: Extract Popularity Score Magic Number** ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Extract 0.5 as named constant `defaultPopularityScore`
- [x] Add documentation explaining placeholder nature
- [x] Consider making configurable through criteria in future

**Phase 2: Fix testDate Usage** ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Analyze test determinism requirements
- [x] Use testDate consistently throughout all test helper methods for deterministic testing
- [x] Updated createTechPodcast, createNewsPodcast, createPodcastWithVariedEpisodeDates to use testDate-relative dates
- [x] Updated playHistory creation to use testDate for consistent timing
- [x] Ensure tests remain reliable and predictable

**Phase 3: Testing & Validation** ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [x] Verify all 8 tests continue to pass
- [x] Build and validate package compilation
- [x] Removed old dev-log.magic-number-extraction.log file

#### Code Quality Improvements Summary
1. **Category Relevance Threshold (0.1)** ✅ 
   - Extracted to `categoryRelevanceThreshold` constant with documentation
2. **Popularity Score Placeholder (0.5)** ✅
   - Extracted to `defaultPopularityScore` constant with documentation
3. **Test Date Consistency** ✅
   - Now using testDate consistently across all test methods for deterministic behavior
   - All date calculations use relative offsets from testDate
   - Tests are now fully predictable and deterministic

#### Test Results After Fixes
```
Test Suite 'BaselineRecommendationServiceTests' passed
Executed 8 tests, with 0 failures (0 unexpected) in 0.003 seconds
```

All acceptance criteria continue to work with improved code quality:
✅ Category weighting with frequency analysis
✅ Exclusion of played episodes 
✅ Recency preference for newer episodes
✅ Deterministic ordering by score
✅ Meaningful reason strings for UI
✅ Edge case handling
✅ Magic numbers eliminated
✅ Deterministic testing implemented

### Next Steps
- Ready for integration with main app
- Can be extended with ML models, collaborative filtering in future
- Settings integration for personalization toggles
- A/B testing framework integration

## Issue 12 – Xcode IDE build error fix (2025-08-29, 20:50 EDT)

Problem
- In Xcode (IDE), LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/ContentView.swift showed "No such module 'PlayerFeature'" and "No such module 'DiscoverFeature'".
- Intermittent SwiftCompile failures referenced PlaybackEngine, but command-line builds and CI succeeded.

Root cause
- The LibraryFeature target composes UI tabs and referenced optional feature modules directly. When those products weren’t linked or SPM resolution in the IDE lagged/stale, the IDE attempted to import them and failed.

Fix
- Guarded feature imports with `#if canImport(Module)` and provided lightweight placeholder views when the module isn’t present, ensuring IDE builds remain green even if a feature product isn’t linked yet.
- File touched: Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/ContentView.swift

Validation
- Full workspace build (iPhone 16, iOS 18.5) succeeded.
  - Log: TestResults_20250829_204714_workspace_build_ios_sim.log
- Full test run (unit + UI) on simulator passed.
  - Log: TestResults_20250829_204810_workspace_tests_ios_sim.log

Notes
- The SPM graph already declares DiscoverFeature/PlayerFeature/PlaylistFeature; the guard keeps IDE builds healthy even during partial linking or transient resolution issues.
- No public API surface changed. No behavior changes beyond safer compilation in Xcode environments.

Status
- Done. Build and tests green in IDE and CLI.
