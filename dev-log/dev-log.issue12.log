# Dev Log: Issue 12 - Recommendations Engine (Baseline Heuristics)

## Design Approach (2024-12-19 EST)

### Problem Statement
- Implement RecommendationService protocol with baseline heuristics
- Input: play history, subscription list
- Output: recommended podcasts + episodes with reason strings
- Heuristics: recently played categories frequency + unplayed episodes recency + popularity placeholder

### Architecture Plan

    A[RecommendationService Protocol] --> B[BaselineRecommendationService]

    B --> E[PopularityScorer]
    
    F[RecommendationModels] --> G[Recommendation]
    F --> H[RecommendationReason]
    F --> I[RecommendationCriteria]

    J[PodcastManaging] --> B
    K[PlaybackHistory] --> B
    L[EpisodeStateManager] --> B
```

### Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1: Core Models** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Created recommendation data models in CoreModels/RecommendationModels.swift
   - Added to existing CoreModels package following established patterns
   - Models: Recommendation, RecommendationReason, RecommendationCriteria, PlaybackHistoryEntry
   - Added RecommendationService protocol definition

2. **Phase 2: Service Package & Implementation** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Created RecommendationDomain package following existing package structure
   - Implemented BaselineRecommendationService with all required heuristics
   - Category frequency analysis with 30-day weighting for recent plays
   - Recency scoring using exponential decay function (30-day half-life)
   - Popularity placeholder scoring (static 0.5 for now)
   - Proper filtering of played episodes when configured

3. **Phase 3: Unit Tests** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Comprehensive test suite with 8 test cases covering all acceptance criteria
   - testAcceptanceCriteria1_CategoryWeighting: verifies higher frequency categories get more recommendations
   - testAcceptanceCriteria2_ExcludePlayedEpisodes: confirms played episodes are excluded when configured
   - testAcceptanceCriteria3_RecencyPreference: validates newer episodes score higher
   - testAcceptanceCriteria4_ReasonStringGeneration: ensures meaningful reason strings
   - Edge case tests: empty history, no podcasts, all episodes played
   - testDeterministicOrdering_SameInputsSameOutput: verifies consistent results
   - All tests pass ✅

4. **Phase 4: Integration** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Added RecommendationDomain to main Package.swift
   - Build and compilation successful
   - No breaking changes to existing code

### Implementation Details

#### Scoring Algorithm Implementation:
1. **Category Frequency Score:**
   - Counts plays by category with 2x weight for plays within last 30 days
   - Normalizes to percentage of total weighted plays
   - Returns highest category score for podcasts with multiple categories

2. **Recency Score:**
   - Uses exponential decay: score = e^(-days_since_publication/30)
   - Gives high scores to very recent episodes, gradually decreasing
   - Episodes without publication dates get score of 0

3. **Combined Score:**
   - Weighted sum: (category * 0.5) + (recency * 0.3) + (popularity * 0.2)
   - Configurable weights via RecommendationCriteria
   - Deterministic sorting by score descending

#### Reason String Generation:
- Primary message: "Recommended for you"
- Details include: category matches, "recent episode" for episodes < 7 days old
- Category weights included for transparency
- User-friendly display text combining primary + details

### Test Results Summary
```
Test Suite 'BaselineRecommendationServiceTests' passed
Executed 8 tests, with 0 failures (0 unexpected) in 0.003 seconds
```

All acceptance criteria successfully implemented:
✅ Category weighting with frequency analysis
✅ Exclusion of played episodes 
✅ Recency preference for newer episodes
✅ Deterministic ordering by score
✅ Meaningful reason strings for UI
✅ Edge case handling

### Next Steps
- Ready for integration with main app
- Can be extended with ML models, collaborative filtering in future
- Settings integration for personalization toggles
- A/B testing framework integration
