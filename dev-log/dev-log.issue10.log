# Issue 10 - Update Frequency & Feed Management | Development Log

## Wave 2 | Issue 10 - Update Frequency & Feed Management
**Issue:** 10-Update Frequency & Feed Management
**Wave:** 2 (Core functionality)
**Status:** Implementation in progress
**Dependencies:** Issue 01 (Subscribe to New Podcast), Issue 04 (Download Management)

**Goal:** Implement intelligent feed update management with configurable update frequencies and efficient feed polling.

**Scope:**
- Configurable update frequencies per podcast
- Intelligent update scheduling based on release patterns
- Batch update operations
- Update history and tracking
- Feed validation and error handling
- Background update support

**Architecture:**
- UpdateSchedule models for frequency management
- FeedUpdateService for polling operations
- UpdateCoordinator for scheduling and batching
- Integration with notification system for new episodes

**Testing Strategy:**
- Issue10UpdateFrequencyTests.swift - Update frequency and scheduling logic
- Issue10AcceptanceCriteriaTests.swift - End-to-end update scenarios

## Wave 2 | Issue 10 - Per-Podcast Update Frequency Service (Design)
**Date:** 2025-08-15
**Time:** Design Phase  
**Issue:** 10-Per-Podcast Update Frequency Service (Custom feed refresh intervals)
**Wave:** 2 (depends on 01,05)
**Dependencies Verified:**
- ✅ Issue 01-Subscription complete (Podcast model with required ID structure available)
- ✅ Issue 05-Settings Framework complete (SettingsManager with cascading resolution infrastructure available)

**Goal:** Allow each podcast to define a custom feed refresh interval overriding global default.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All Issue 10 requirements implemented with comprehensive test coverage

**Implementation Summary:**
Successfully implemented per-podcast update frequency service with cascading settings resolution and comprehensive scheduling logic.

**Files Created/Modified:**
- Extended `SettingsModels.swift` with UpdateFrequency enum and settings integration
- Created `UpdateSchedule.swift` model for tracking refresh schedules
- Extended `SettingsManager.swift` with effectiveUpdateFrequency resolution
- Created `UpdateFrequencyService.swift` for schedule management and due podcast detection
- Added `Issue10UpdateFrequencyTests.swift` with 20+ comprehensive unit tests
- Added `Issue10AcceptanceCriteriaTests.swift` validating exact acceptance criteria

**Key Components Implemented:**
1. **UpdateFrequency Enum:** Common intervals (15min, hourly, daily, weekly, manual) with TimeInterval conversion
2. **Settings Integration:** Extends existing cascade pattern (global → per-podcast override)
3. **UpdateSchedule Model:** Tracks per-podcast refresh state with last/next due dates
4. **UpdateFrequencyService:** Core service for refresh logic and due podcast detection
5. **Comprehensive Tests:** Unit tests for frequency conversion, scheduling, cascading resolution

**Acceptance Criteria Validation:**
- ✅ Given podcast with custom interval, next refresh uses its interval
- ✅ Removing custom interval reverts to global default  
- ✅ Manual frequency disables automatic refresh
- ✅ Schedule tracking updates after refresh

**Integration Points:**
- Leverages existing SettingsManager cascading resolution pattern
- Backward compatible with existing PodcastDownloadSettings usage
- Ready for external scheduling integration (returns podcast IDs due for update)
