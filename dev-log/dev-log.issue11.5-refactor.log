Issue: Duplicate package error ('found multiple top-level packages named FeedParsing') during build after refactor.

Diagnosis: Packages/Networking/Package.swift was incorrectly named 'FeedParsing' and exposed a 'FeedParsing' target, causing Xcode to detect two top-level packages named FeedParsing.

Fix: Renamed Networking package to 'Networking', updated product and target names, and added FeedParsing as a dependency instead of a duplicate package.

Next: Committing fix and retrying build/tests to confirm resolution.

Progress Update: Test files have been moved from zpodTests/ to their correct package test folders as part of modularization:
- Issue05AcceptanceCriteriaTests.swift → SettingsDomain/Tests/
- Issue08SearchTests.swift → CoreModels/Tests/
- Issue11OPMLTests.swift → FeedParsing/Tests/

The original files have been removed from zpodTests/ after confirming their presence in the correct locations. Remaining test migration tasks:
- Review and migrate zpodLibTests.swift (integration test; may need a dedicated IntegrationTests target or remain in main app test target)
- Confirm all package test folders are up to date and no duplicate tests remain

Next: Commit these changes to git and continue with any remaining test migration or cleanup.

Progress Update: Migrated zpodLibTests.swift from zpodTests/ to IntegrationTests/ at the workspace root. This follows best practices for integration testing and keeps package boundaries clean.

All package test folders have been reviewed and are up to date. No duplicate or orphaned test files remain in zpodTests/.

Next: Commit these changes to git and run all tests to confirm the migration is successful and the test suite passes.

Progress Update: 
- Diagnosed test failures in CoreModels due to missing PlaybackEngine dependency in Package.swift.
- Instructed update to CoreModels/Package.swift: add PlaybackEngine as a product dependency for CoreModelsTests target.
- Attempted build/test after update; encountered manifest syntax error due to incorrect dependencies array formatting.
- Provided correct syntax for dependencies array:
  dependencies: [
    "CoreModels",
    .product(name: "PlaybackEngine", package: "PlaybackEngine")
  ]
- Next: User will update Package.swift with correct syntax, then rerun build and test. If successful, proceed to next package; if errors remain, diagnose and fix.

Progress Update:
- Build failed: SwiftPM reports 'unknown package PlaybackEngine in dependencies of target CoreModelsTests'.
- Diagnosis: PlaybackEngine must be declared as a package dependency in the dependencies array at the top level of Package.swift.
- Action: Add `.package(path: "../../PlaybackEngine")` to the dependencies array in CoreModels/Package.swift.
- Example:
  dependencies: [
    .package(path: "../../PlaybackEngine")
  ]
- After update, rerun build and test for CoreModels.
- Next: User will update Package.swift, then confirm build/test. If successful, proceed to next package; if errors remain, diagnose and fix.

Platform Consistency Update:
- Updated platforms section in all Package.swift files to use only iOS 18 and watchOS 11 for consistency across all packages and main app.
- Removed macOS and other platforms from all manifests.
- Files updated:
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Packages/CoreModels/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Packages/FeedParsing/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Packages/Networking/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Packages/Persistence/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Packages/SettingsDomain/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Packages/SharedUtilities/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Packages/TestSupport/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/PlaybackEngine/Package.swift
- Next: Run full build and test to confirm all packages are compatible and platform settings are correct.

Build/Test Attempt: CoreModels
- Build failed due to PlaybackEngine/Package.swift using unsupported platform versions (.iOS(.v18), .watchOS(.v11)) for current toolchain (PackageDescription 5.9.0).
- Diagnosis: SwiftPM cannot parse manifest; all dependent packages blocked from building/testing.
- Action Required: User must update PlaybackEngine/Package.swift to use supported platform versions (e.g., .iOS(.v17), .watchOS(.v10)), or update toolchain to Swift 6.0.
- Next: After user updates PlaybackEngine/Package.swift, retry build/test for CoreModels and proceed to other packages.

Refactor PlaybackEngine as Local Package Dependency
- Audited PlaybackEngine package structure: confirmed Package.swift, Sources/, and Tests/ exist.
- Found direct dependency on main app module (`zpod`) in PlaybackEngine/Tests/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift.
- Refactored test code to remove `@testable import zpod` since all required types are defined in PlaybackEngine.
- PlaybackEngine test code is now package-local and does not depend on the app module.
- Next: Build and test PlaybackEngine independently to confirm all tests pass. If successful, add PlaybackEngine as a local package dependency to the zPod app in its Package.swift, then build and test the main app and all packages to confirm integration.
