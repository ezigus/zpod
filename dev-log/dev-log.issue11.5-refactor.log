Issue: Duplicate package error ('found multiple top-level packages named FeedParsing') during build after refactor.

Diagnosis: Packages/Networking/Package.swift was incorrectly named 'FeedParsing' and exposed a 'FeedParsing' target, causing Xcode to detect two top-level packages named FeedParsing.

Fix: Renamed Networking package to 'Networking', updated product and target names, and added FeedParsing as a dependency instead of a duplicate package.

Next: Committing fix and retrying build/tests to confirm resolution.

Progress Update: Test files have been moved from zpodTests/ to their correct package test folders as part of modularization:
- Issue05AcceptanceCriteriaTests.swift → SettingsDomain/Tests/
- Issue08SearchTests.swift → CoreModels/Tests/
- Issue11OPMLTests.swift → FeedParsing/Tests/

The original files have been removed from zpodTests/ after confirming their presence in the correct locations. Remaining test migration tasks:
- Review and migrate zpodLibTests.swift (integration test; may need a dedicated IntegrationTests target or remain in main app test target)
- Confirm all package test folders are up to date and no duplicate tests remain

Next: Commit these changes to git and continue with any remaining test migration or cleanup.
