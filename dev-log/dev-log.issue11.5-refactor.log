Issue: Duplicate package error ('found multiple top-level packages named FeedParsing') during build after refactor.

Diagnosis: Packages/Networking/Package.swift was incorrectly named 'FeedParsing' and exposed a 'FeedParsing' target, causing Xcode to detect two top-level packages named FeedParsing.

Fix: Renamed Networking package to 'Networking', updated product and target names, and added FeedParsing as a dependency instead of a duplicate package.

Next: Committing fix and retrying build/tests to confirm resolution.

2025-08-21
---
Progress Update: Test files have been moved from zpodTests/ to their correct package test folders as part of modularization:
- Issue05AcceptanceCriteriaTests.swift → SettingsDomain/Tests/
- Issue08SearchTests.swift → CoreModels/Tests/
- Issue11OPMLTests.swift → FeedParsing/Tests/

The original files have been removed from zpodTests/ after confirming their presence in the correct locations. Remaining test migration tasks:
- Review and migrate zpodLibTests.swift (integration test; may need a dedicated IntegrationTests target or remain in main app test target)
- Confirm all package test folders are up to date and no duplicate tests remain

Next: Commit these changes to git and continue with any remaining test migration or cleanup.

Progress Update: Migrated zpodLibTests.swift from zpodTests/ to IntegrationTests/ at the workspace root. This follows best practices for integration testing and keeps package boundaries clean.

All package test folders have been reviewed and are up to date. No duplicate or orphaned test files remain in zpodTests/.

Next: Commit these changes to git and run all tests to confirm the migration is successful and the test suite passes.

Progress Update:
- Diagnosed test failures in CoreModels due to missing PlaybackEngine dependency in Package.swift.
- Instructed update to CoreModels/Package.swift: add PlaybackEngine as a product dependency for CoreModelsTests target.
- Attempted build/test after update; encountered manifest syntax error due to incorrect dependencies array formatting.
- Provided correct syntax for dependencies array:
  dependencies: [
    "CoreModels",
    .product(name: "PlaybackEngine", package: "PlaybackEngine")
  ]
- Next: User will update Package.swift with correct syntax, then rerun build and test. If successful, proceed to next package; if errors remain, diagnose and fix.

2025-08-21 15:10
---
Progress Update:
- Build failed: SwiftPM reports 'unknown package PlaybackEngine in dependencies of target CoreModelsTests'.
- Diagnosis: PlaybackEngine must be declared as a package dependency in the dependencies array at the top level of Package.swift.
- Action: Add `.package(path: "../../PlaybackEngine")` to the dependencies array in CoreModels/Package.swift.
- Example:
  dependencies: [
    .package(path: "../../PlaybackEngine")
  ]
- After update, rerun build and test for CoreModels.
- Next: User will update Package.swift, then confirm build/test. If successful, proceed to next package; if errors remain, diagnose and fix.

2025-08-21 15:20
---
Platform Consistency Update:
- Updated platforms section in all Package.swift files to use only iOS 18 and watchOS 11 for consistency across all packages and main app.
- Removed macOS and other platforms from all manifests.
- Files updated:
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Packages/CoreModels/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Packages/FeedParsing/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Packages/Networking/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Packages/Persistence/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Packages/SettingsDomain/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Packages/SharedUtilities/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Packages/TestSupport/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/PlaybackEngine/Package.swift
- Next: Run full build and test to confirm all packages are compatible and platform settings are correct.

2025-08-21 15:30

Build/Test Attempt: CoreModels
- Build failed due to PlaybackEngine/Package.swift using unsupported platform versions (.iOS(.v18), .watchOS(.v11)) for current toolchain (PackageDescription 5.9.0).
- Diagnosis: SwiftPM cannot parse manifest; all dependent packages blocked from building/testing.
- Action Required: User must update PlaybackEngine/Package.swift to use supported platform versions (e.g., .iOS(.v17), .watchOS(.v10)), or update toolchain to Swift 6.0.
- Next: After user updates PlaybackEngine/Package.swift, retry build/test for CoreModels and proceed to other packages.

2025-08-21 16:10

Refactor PlaybackEngine as Local Package Dependency
- Audited PlaybackEngine package structure: confirmed Package.swift, Sources/, and Tests/ exist.
- Found direct dependency on main app module (`zpod`) in PlaybackEngine/Tests/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift.
- Refactored test code to remove `@testable import zpod` since all required types are defined in PlaybackEngine.
- PlaybackEngine test code is now package-local and does not depend on the app module.
- Next: Build and test PlaybackEngine independently to confirm all tests pass. If successful, add PlaybackEngine as a local package dependency to the zPod app in its Package.swift, then build and test the main app and all packages to confirm integration.

2025-08-22
---
Diagnosis: Build failures in CoreModels due to missing Playlist and SmartPlaylist model definitions. These types are required by InMemoryPlaylistManager and related code, but were not present in CoreModels after refactor.

Action: Added minimal stubs for Playlist and SmartPlaylist to CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels. Playlist includes id and episodeIds properties, and a withEpisodes(_:) method. SmartPlaylist includes id property.

Next: Commit these changes, rerun build and tests for CoreModels and FeedParsing, and continue modularization review for other packages.

2025-08-22 09:10

Approach for fixing CoreModels and PlaybackEngine test build errors:
- Remove invalid `import SettingsModels` from CoreModels/DownloadSettings.swift; use local types from SettingsModels.swift instead.
- Remove or fix `@testable import zpod` in PlaybackEngine/Tests/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift, as zpod is not a SwiftPM package target.
- After each fix, re-run tests to verify resolution.

Progress:
- Preparing to edit DownloadSettings.swift and InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift to resolve module import errors.

2025-08-22 09:30
---
Approach for resolving CoreModels build/test errors:
- Audit all CoreModels source files for duplicate/conflicting type definitions (Playlist, SmartPlaylist, PlaylistChange, NotificationSettings, PodcastPlaybackSettings).
- Consolidate each type into a single definition in the appropriate file (Playlist.swift for playlist types, SettingsModels.swift for settings types).
- Remove duplicate definitions and update imports/references in all affected files.
- Fix ambiguity and redeclaration errors.
- Re-run tests after each fix and log results.
- Commit code and dev-log updates together.

Progress:
- Playlist.swift contains canonical definitions for Playlist and SmartPlaylist.
- InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift has a duplicate PlaylistChange enum; will remove and use the canonical type from Playlist.swift.
- Will audit DownloadSettings.swift, PlaybackSettings.swift, and SettingsModels.swift for similar issues next.

Issue11.5 – Approach & Kickoff
- Goal: Compile and test all packages and the app workspace. Do not modify code based on errors; only capture and log results.
- Plan:
  1) Run full Xcode test suite for workspace scheme 'zpod' on an iOS simulator and save result bundle/log.
  2) For each local package (SharedUtilities, CoreModels, Persistence, SettingsDomain, PlaybackEngine, Networking, FeedParsing, TestSupport):
     - List schemes with xcodebuild -list -packagePath.
     - Build and, where available, run tests with xcodebuild against iOS Simulator.
     - Save separate result bundles/logs per package.
  3) Summarize PASS/FAIL per target.
- Notes: No code edits will be made in response to failures in this run.

Workspace Test Run (scheme: zpod)
- Command: scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh (default args)
- Simulator: iPhone 16 (iOS 18.6)
- Result: FAILED (build failed; tests cancelled)
- Primary failure: Persistence target compile errors related to Swift 6 actor isolation on publisher properties
  • FileManagerService.downloadProgressPublisher (actor-isolated vs nonisolated protocol requirement)
  • UserDefaultsSettingsRepository.settingsChangedPublisher (actor-isolated vs nonisolated protocol requirement)
- Result bundle: TestResults_20250822_143317/
- Log: TestResults_20250822_143317.log
- Note: Per instructions, no code changes were made; proceeding to per-package build/test to capture independent status.

Summary of Package Issues and Action Plan

Packages in zPod:
- CoreModels
- FeedParsing
- Networking
- Persistence
- PlaybackEngine
- SearchDomain
- SettingsDomain
- SharedUtilities
- TestSupport

Recent Issues:
- Duplicate package error (Networking/FeedParsing): Fixed by renaming Networking manifest and updating dependencies.
- Test migration: All tests moved to correct package folders; integration tests now in IntegrationTests target.
- Dependency issues: CoreModelsTests required PlaybackEngine; manifest syntax and missing package references resolved.
- Platform consistency: All Package.swift files updated to iOS 18/watchOS 11.
- Build failures: PlaybackEngine/Package.swift uses unsupported platform versions for current toolchain (SwiftPM 5.9.0), blocking builds.

Action Plan:
- [ ] 1. PlaybackEngine Manifest Update
      - Update PlaybackEngine/Package.swift to use supported platform versions (e.g., .iOS(.v17), .watchOS(.v10)) or upgrade toolchain to Swift 6.0.
      - Progress: Pending. Awaiting manifest update and build/test verification.

- [ ] 2. Dependency Verification
      - Double-check all Package.swift files for correct dependency declarations and product/target names.
      - Progress: Pending. Will audit manifests after PlaybackEngine manifest is fixed.

- [ ] 3. Test Suite Validation
      - Run all package/integration tests to confirm migration and modularization are successful.
      - Progress: Pending. Will run after build issues are resolved.

- [ ] 4. Platform Consistency
      - Ensure all packages and main app use the same supported platform versions.
      - Progress: Pending. Will confirm after manifest updates and dependency audit.

- [ ] 5. Documentation and Logging
      - Document all changes/decisions in dev-log for issue11.5, with timestamps.
      - Progress: Ongoing. Approach and progress are being logged with timestamps.

Next: Begin with PlaybackEngine manifest update and log progress here.

2025-08-22 15:10 ET

Dependency Verification (Step 2)

- All Package.swift manifests specify swift-tools-version: 6.0 and platforms [.iOS(.v18), .watchOS(.v11)], which are compatible with the active Swift 6.1.2 toolchain.
- Dependencies across packages are correctly declared:
    - CoreModels depends on PlaybackEngine
    - FeedParsing, Networking, Persistence, SettingsDomain, TestSupport, SearchDomain depend on CoreModels and SharedUtilities as needed
    - No duplicate or orphaned dependencies found
    - Product/target names are consistent

Progress: Dependency verification complete. Ready to run builds/tests for each package.

Next: Proceed to Test Suite Validation (Step 3) and log results.

2025-08-22 19:26 ET
---
Action Plan Status Update (Checkboxes)

- [x] 1. PlaybackEngine Manifest Update
      - Status: Complete. Using swift-tools-version: 6.0 with platforms [.iOS(.v18), .watchOS(.v11)] and active toolchain Swift 6.1.2.
- [x] 2. Dependency Verification
      - Status: Complete. All Package.swift manifests validated; dependencies/product names consistent; no duplicates/orphans.
- [ ] 3. Test Suite Validation
      - Status: In progress. Running workspace and per-package builds/tests and logging results.
- [ ] 4. Platform Consistency
      - Status: Pending. Will finalize after Step 3 completes.
- [ ] 5. Documentation and Logging
      - Status: Ongoing. Dev-log and TestResults updated between each run.

2025-08-22 15:20 ET

- Note: Persistent build/test failures despite individual package build success. Further investigation needed for Persistence package actor isolation issues.

2025-08-22 19:46 ET
---
Per-Package Unit Test Plan (Step 3 continued)
- Objective: Run unit tests for each package scheme where tests exist, without making code changes. Capture logs per run in TestResults/ and summarize PASS/FAIL.
- Target schemes: CoreModels, SharedUtilities, Persistence, FeedParsing, Networking, SettingsDomain, SearchDomain, TestSupport, PlaybackEngine. Also check for an IntegrationTests scheme.
- Device: iPhone 16 (iOS 18.5) Simulator
- Logging: Write console output to TestResults/TestResults_<Scheme>_<YYYYMMDD_HHMM>_tests.log and keep last 30 results.
- Note: If a scheme has no tests, record "No tests found" and consider the test run as N/A (build success still noted).

Next: List available schemes, then run tests sequentially and log results between each run.

2025-08-22 19:48 ET
---
Per-Package Unit Tests: CoreModels (Attempt 1)
- Command: xcodebuild -workspace zpod.xcworkspace -scheme CoreModels -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16,OS=18.5' test
- Result: NO TESTS EXECUTED (no test summary in output)
- Observations:
  • Log shows only Resolve Package Graph and resolved packages; no build/test phases ran
  • Message present: "Source files for target SharedUtilitiesTests should be located under 'Tests/SharedUtilitiesTests'..." (likely unrelated resolver notice)
- Log: TestResults/TestResults_CoreModels_20250822_1946_tests.log

- Command: xcodebuild -workspace zpod.xcworkspace -scheme Persistence -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16,OS=18.5' test
- Result: NO TESTS EXECUTED (no build/test phases ran)
- Observations:
  • Log shows Resolve Package Graph only; no compilation or test discovery output
  • Note: Workspace-level builds previously failed in Persistence due to Swift 6 actor isolation; tests likely blocked by build issues or scheme config

IntegrationTests Scheme Attempt
- Command: xcodebuild -workspace zpod.xcworkspace -scheme IntegrationTests -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16,OS=18.5' test
- Result: SCHEME NOT FOUND/NO OUTPUT (no CLI output captured; no log created)
- Notes: IntegrationTests target may not have a shared scheme; requires manual Xcode verification in a future pass.

2025-08-22 20:18 ET
---
TestResults Log Rotation – Outcome
- Evaluation: For each scheme, 3 or fewer logs exist; no deletions required to meet the "keep latest 3" policy.
- Workspace logs without scheme prefix retained.

Workspace Test Run (scheme: zpod) – Attempt 3
- Device: iPhone 16 (iOS 18.5) Simulator
- Command: xcodebuild -workspace zpod.xcworkspace -scheme zpod -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16,OS=18.5' test
- Result: FAILED (build failed; tests cancelled)
- Primary failures observed:
  • Persistence/FileManagerService.swift: actor-isolated property 'downloadProgressPublisher' cannot satisfy nonisolated requirement from protocol 'FileManagerServicing' (compiler suggests adding '@preconcurrency' to conformance)
  • TestSupport/InMemoryPodcastManager.swift: SwiftCompile failed with a nonzero exit code (details in log)
- Log: TestResults/TestResults_zpod_20250822_2023_tests.log
- Notes: Build advanced further than prior attempt, compiling several package modules before failing on Persistence and TestSupport.

2025-08-22 20:26 ET
---
Status Summary (Step 3 to-date)
- Package builds:
  • PASS: CoreModels, SharedUtilities, FeedParsing, Networking, SettingsDomain, SearchDomain, TestSupport, PlaybackEngine
  • FAIL: Persistence (Swift 6 actor isolation on publisher properties)
- Package tests:
  • NO TESTS EXECUTED for CoreModels, Persistence, FeedParsing, SettingsDomain, SharedUtilities, Networking, SearchDomain, TestSupport, PlaybackEngine (schemes' Test actions likely lack test targets)
- Workspace tests (scheme: zpod): FAILED; blocked by Persistence actor-isolation error and a TestSupport compile error; tests cancelled.
- Logs dir: /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/TestResults/ (see timestamped *_tests.log and prior build logs)

2025-08-22 20:32 ET
---
Persistence Build Failure Fix Plan
- Symptom: Swift 6 actor isolation errors in Persistence for publisher properties
  • FileManagerService.downloadProgressPublisher cannot satisfy nonisolated protocol requirement
  • UserDefaultsSettingsRepository.settingsChangedPublisher cannot satisfy nonisolated protocol requirement
- Approach:
  • Ensure protocol publisher requirements use async getter to allow cross-actor access
  • Add @preconcurrency to protocol conformances to defer isolation/sendability checks for Combine types
  • Keep @preconcurrency import Combine as-is
- Files to change:
  • Packages/Persistence/Sources/Persistence/FileManagerService.swift (conformance annotation)
  • Packages/Persistence/Sources/Persistence/SettingsRepository.swift (conformance annotation)
- Validation:
  • Rebuild Persistence scheme and capture TestResults log
  • If still failing, revisit protocol requirements and isolation attributes

2025-01-02 16:15 ET

Unit Testing Initiative - Starting with CoreModels Package
- Objective: Write comprehensive unit tests for each package based on spec requirements, starting with CoreModels
- Current Status Analysis:
  • CoreModels package structure exists with 16 source files
  • Current test files in Tests/CoreModelsTests/ but tests not executing properly
  • Build issues with PlaybackEngine dependency (AVFoundation import errors blocking Linux build)
  • Need to write tests that align with spec.md requirements using Given/When/Then patterns

- Approach for CoreModels Testing:
  1. Fix immediate build blocking issues (AVFoundation cross-platform compatibility)
  2. Write comprehensive unit tests for each model:
     - Podcast model: subscription, metadata, settings override capabilities
     - Episode model: playback state, download state, chapter navigation
     - Playlist/SmartPlaylist: episode management, continuous playback, ordering
     - DownloadTask: state management, retry logic, priority handling
     - Settings models: global vs per-podcast configuration cascading
     - Search models: keyword filtering, result management
     - OPML models: import/export functionality
  3. Ensure tests follow Swift 6 concurrency best practices with async/await
  4. Use XCTest framework with descriptive test names matching spec scenarios
  5. Validate all tests pass before moving to next package

- Plan: CoreModels → SharedUtilities → TestSupport → Persistence → (remaining packages)
- Next: Fix PlaybackEngine AVFoundation imports, then implement CoreModels unit tests

2025-01-02 16:45 ET

CoreModels Unit Testing Implementation Progress
- Status: ✅ COMPREHENSIVE UNIT TESTS CREATED
- Actions Completed:
  1. ✅ Fixed PlaybackEngine AVFoundation cross-platform compatibility issues
  2. ✅ Removed PlaybackEngine dependency from CoreModels Package.swift to focus on core models
  3. ✅ Created comprehensive test suites for all core models:
     - ComprehensivePodcastTests.swift: 25+ test methods covering subscription, organization, codable, edge cases
     - ComprehensiveEpisodeTests.swift: 30+ test methods covering playback state, immutability, validation
     - ComprehensivePlaylistTests.swift: 35+ test methods covering manual/smart playlists, criteria, filtering
     - ComprehensiveDownloadTaskTests.swift: 40+ test methods covering priority, state management, retry logic
     - ComprehensiveSearchTests.swift: 30+ test methods covering search results, queries, filters
  4. ✅ Enhanced SearchModels.swift with missing types (SearchQuery, SearchResults, DateRange, Note)
  5. ✅ Added proper Codable conformance to SearchResult enum with custom implementation
  6. ✅ Fixed test setUp() methods for Swift 6 async compliance
  7. ✅ Aligned tests with actual model implementations (DownloadState, DownloadError enums)

- Test Coverage Includes:
  • Model initialization and property validation
  • Codable serialization/deserialization
  • Equatable conformance and edge cases
  • Immutable functional updates (withPlaybackPosition, withEpisodes, etc.)
  • Swift 6 Sendable compliance
  • Spec-based requirements (Given/When/Then patterns)
  • Edge cases: Unicode, empty strings, large data sets, boundary values

- Next: Run final test suite to validate all tests pass, then proceed to next package
