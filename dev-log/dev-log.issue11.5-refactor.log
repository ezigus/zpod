Issue: Duplicate package error ('found multiple top-level packages named FeedParsing') during build after refactor.

Diagnosis: Packages/Networking/Package.swift was incorrectly named 'FeedParsing' and exposed a 'FeedParsing' target, causing Xcode to detect two top-level packages named FeedParsing.

Fix: Renamed Networking package to 'Networking', updated product and target names, and added FeedParsing as a dependency instead of a duplicate package.

Next: Committing fix and retrying build/tests to confirm resolution.

Progress Update: Test files have been moved from zpodTests/ to their correct package test folders as part of modularization:
- Issue05AcceptanceCriteriaTests.swift → SettingsDomain/Tests/
- Issue08SearchTests.swift → CoreModels/Tests/
- Issue11OPMLTests.swift → FeedParsing/Tests/

The original files have been removed from zpodTests/ after confirming their presence in the correct locations. Remaining test migration tasks:
- Review and migrate zpodLibTests.swift (integration test; may need a dedicated IntegrationTests target or remain in main app test target)
- Confirm all package test folders are up to date and no duplicate tests remain

Next: Commit these changes to git and continue with any remaining test migration or cleanup.

Progress Update: Migrated zpodLibTests.swift from zpodTests/ to IntegrationTests/ at the workspace root. This follows best practices for integration testing and keeps package boundaries clean.

All package test folders have been reviewed and are up to date. No duplicate or orphaned test files remain in zpodTests/.

Next: Commit these changes to git and run all tests to confirm the migration is successful and the test suite passes.

Progress Update:
- Diagnosed test failures in CoreModels due to missing PlaybackEngine dependency in Package.swift.
- Instructed update to CoreModels/Package.swift: add PlaybackEngine as a product dependency for CoreModelsTests target.
- Attempted build/test after update; encountered manifest syntax error due to incorrect dependencies array formatting.
- Provided correct syntax for dependencies array:
  dependencies: [
    "CoreModels",
    .product(name: "PlaybackEngine", package: "PlaybackEngine")
  ]
- Next: User will update Package.swift with correct syntax, then rerun build and test. If successful, proceed to next package; if errors remain, diagnose and fix.

Progress Update:
- Build failed: SwiftPM reports 'unknown package PlaybackEngine in dependencies of target CoreModelsTests'.
- Diagnosis: PlaybackEngine must be declared as a package dependency in the dependencies array at the top level of Package.swift.
- Action: Add `.package(path: "../../PlaybackEngine")` to the dependencies array in CoreModels/Package.swift.
- Example:
  dependencies: [
    .package(path: "../../PlaybackEngine")
  ]
- After update, rerun build and test for CoreModels.
- Next: User will update Package.swift, then confirm build/test. If successful, proceed to next package; if errors remain, diagnose and fix.

Platform Consistency Update:
- Updated platforms section in all Package.swift files to use only iOS 18 and watchOS 11 for consistency across all packages and main app.
- Removed macOS and other platforms from all manifests.
- Files updated:
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Packages/CoreModels/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Packages/FeedParsing/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Packages/Networking/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Packages/Persistence/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Packages/SettingsDomain/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Packages/SharedUtilities/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/Packages/TestSupport/Package.swift
  - /Users/ericziegler/code/zpod/PlaybackEngine/Package.swift
- Next: Run full build and test to confirm all packages are compatible and platform settings are correct.

Build/Test Attempt: CoreModels
- Build failed due to PlaybackEngine/Package.swift using unsupported platform versions (.iOS(.v18), .watchOS(.v11)) for current toolchain (PackageDescription 5.9.0).
- Diagnosis: SwiftPM cannot parse manifest; all dependent packages blocked from building/testing.
- Action Required: User must update PlaybackEngine/Package.swift to use supported platform versions (e.g., .iOS(.v17), .watchOS(.v10)), or update toolchain to Swift 6.0.
- Next: After user updates PlaybackEngine/Package.swift, retry build/test for CoreModels and proceed to other packages.

Refactor PlaybackEngine as Local Package Dependency
- Audited PlaybackEngine package structure: confirmed Package.swift, Sources/, and Tests/ exist.
- Found direct dependency on main app module (`zpod`) in PlaybackEngine/Tests/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift.
- Refactored test code to remove `@testable import zpod` since all required types are defined in PlaybackEngine.
- PlaybackEngine test code is now package-local and does not depend on the app module.
- Next: Build and test PlaybackEngine independently to confirm all tests pass. If successful, add PlaybackEngine as a local package dependency to the zPod app in its Package.swift, then build and test the main app and all packages to confirm integration.

Diagnosis: Build failures in CoreModels due to missing Playlist and SmartPlaylist model definitions. These types are required by InMemoryPlaylistManager and related code, but were not present in CoreModels after refactor.

Action: Added minimal stubs for Playlist and SmartPlaylist to CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels. Playlist includes id and episodeIds properties, and a withEpisodes(_:) method. SmartPlaylist includes id property.

Next: Commit these changes, rerun build and tests for CoreModels and FeedParsing, and continue modularization review for other packages.

Approach for fixing CoreModels and PlaybackEngine test build errors:
- Remove invalid `import SettingsModels` from CoreModels/DownloadSettings.swift; use local types from SettingsModels.swift instead.
- Remove or fix `@testable import zpod` in PlaybackEngine/Tests/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift, as zpod is not a SwiftPM package target.
- After each fix, re-run tests to verify resolution.

Progress:
- Preparing to edit DownloadSettings.swift and InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift to resolve module import errors.

Approach for resolving CoreModels build/test errors:
- Audit all CoreModels source files for duplicate/conflicting type definitions (Playlist, SmartPlaylist, PlaylistChange, NotificationSettings, PodcastPlaybackSettings).
- Consolidate each type into a single definition in the appropriate file (Playlist.swift for playlist types, SettingsModels.swift for settings types).
- Remove duplicate definitions and update imports/references in all affected files.
- Fix ambiguity and redeclaration errors.
- Re-run tests after each fix and log results.
- Commit code and dev-log updates together.

Progress:
- Playlist.swift contains canonical definitions for Playlist and SmartPlaylist.
- InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift has a duplicate PlaylistChange enum; will remove and use the canonical type from Playlist.swift.
- Will audit DownloadSettings.swift, PlaybackSettings.swift, and SettingsModels.swift for similar issues next.

Continuing modularization: Package compilation status review and fixes

Current Build Status (from last session):
✅ CoreModels: Building successfully
✅ SharedUtilities: Building successfully  
✅ TestSupport: Building successfully
✅ Persistence: Building successfully
✅ SearchDomain: Building successfully
✅ FeedParsing: Building successfully
🔄 SettingsDomain: Multiple compilation errors
🔄 Networking: Multiple compilation errors

Key Issues to Fix:
1. SettingsDomain: Missing Combine imports, incorrect property access on PodcastPlaybackSettings, optional unwrapping issues
2. Networking: DownloadTask missing state/withState, missing DownloadProgress/DownloadError types, priority comparison type mismatch

Approach:
1. Fix SettingsDomain Combine imports and property access issues
2. Add missing state management to DownloadTask model
3. Add missing types for Networking package
4. Update Networking to use proper dependencies (needs Persistence for StoragePolicyEvaluator)
5. Test each package individually after fixes
