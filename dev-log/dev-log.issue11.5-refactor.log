Issue: Duplicate package error ('found multiple top-level packages named FeedParsing') during build after refactor.

Diagnosis: Packages/Networking/Package.swift was incorrectly named 'FeedParsing' and exposed a 'FeedParsing' target, causing Xcode to detect two top-level packages named FeedParsing.

Fix: Renamed Networking package to 'Networking', updated product and target names, and added FeedParsing as a dependency instead of a duplicate package.

Next: Committing fix and retrying build/tests to confirm resolution.
