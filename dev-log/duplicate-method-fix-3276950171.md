# Dev Log: Duplicate buildRuleValue() Method Fix
**Comment ID**: 3276950171  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Issue**: Fix duplicate method redeclaration in SmartListRuleBuilderView.swift  

## Problem Statement
User reported build errors due to duplicate `buildRuleValue()` method declarations within the same file. The error showed:

```
SmartListRuleBuilderView.swift:463:10: error: invalid redeclaration of 'buildRuleValue()'
    func buildRuleValue() -> SmartListRuleValue? {
         ^
SmartListRuleBuilderView.swift:88:18: note: 'buildRuleValue()' previously declared here
    private func buildRuleValue() -> SmartListRuleValue? {
                 ^
```

## Root Cause Analysis
Investigation revealed duplicate `buildRuleValue()` methods in the same file:

1. **Line 88**: Private method in the main `SmartListRuleBuilder` class
2. **Line 463**: Public method in an extension of `SmartListRuleBuilder`

Both methods had identical implementations, causing a redeclaration error. This was different from the previous duplicate class issue (which was across different files).

## Solution Implemented

### Fix: Remove Duplicate Extension Method
- **File**: `Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/SmartListRuleBuilderView.swift`
- **Action**: Removed entire duplicate extension with `buildRuleValue()` method (lines 462-488)
- **Rationale**: Keep the existing private method in the main class, remove redundant extension method

**Extension Removed**:
```swift
extension SmartListRuleBuilder {
    func buildRuleValue() -> SmartListRuleValue? {
        // ... identical implementation to private method
    }
}
```

**Kept Original Private Method** (Line 88):
```swift
private func buildRuleValue() -> SmartListRuleValue? {
    switch type {
    case .playStatus:
        return .episodeStatus(episodeStatusValue)
    // ... rest of implementation
    }
}
```

## Validation Results
- ✅ All syntax checks pass
- ✅ No redeclaration errors
- ✅ Build error resolved
- ✅ Functionality preserved with private method

## Cycle Prevention Analysis
Checked previous fixes in dev-log - this is NOT a repeated fix:
- Previous issue: Duplicate `EpisodeSearchViewModel` classes across different files (commit fd2a731)
- Current issue: Duplicate `buildRuleValue()` methods within same file
- Different root causes, different solutions

## Key Learnings
1. **Method Duplication**: Extensions can accidentally duplicate existing class methods
2. **Code Review**: Check for duplicate implementations when adding extensions
3. **Access Control**: Private methods are often sufficient for internal class functionality

## Files Modified
1. `Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/SmartListRuleBuilderView.swift` - Removed duplicate extension method

**Next Action**: Commit changes and report progress
