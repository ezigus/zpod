# Dev Log: Issue 03.3.3 - Feed Parsing (audioURL & duration)

**Issue**: [#268](https://github.com/ezigus/zpod/issues/268)  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented on feature/03.3.3-feed-parsing; follow-ups required

## 2026-01-25 07:55 ET — Branch assessment and traceability

- Implemented RSS enclosure extraction and duration parsing in `RSSFeedParser`.
- Duration parser handles seconds, HH:MM:SS, and MM:SS; invalid formats yield nil.
- Missing enclosures are preserved with `audioURL = nil` and a warning log.
- Tests cover synthetic RSS/iTunes XML for enclosures, durations, metadata, and edge cases.
- Gap: Tests and fixtures are synthetic (`example.com`); no captured real-world feeds exercised.
- Gap: Invalid `enclosure url` values are dropped silently; logging does not differentiate malformed vs missing URLs.

## 2026-01-25 07:55 ET — Follow-up requirements (to be addressed next)

- Add sanitized fixtures from at least one real podcast feed (e.g., ATP, The Talk Show) and assert parsed `audioURL` and `duration`.
- Add explicit logging for malformed enclosure URLs separate from missing URLs; unit test the malformed-path to ensure non-crashing behavior.
- Keep issue 03.3.3 acceptance criteria aligned with the above before final closure.
