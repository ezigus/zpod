# Dev Log: Issue 03.1.1.7 – Player Tab Full Player

## 2026-01-01 16:20 ET – Intent & Design Notes

**Intent**: Replace the Player tab’s simplified player UI with the full player interface so there is a single, consistent player surface in the app.

**Design Notes**:
- Player tab embeds `ExpandedPlayerView` instead of a placeholder player.
- Full player remains accessible from the mini-player via sheet presentation.
- Use the shared playback service so state is consistent across mini and full player.
- Show a neutral empty state when no episode is active.
- Consider hiding the drag indicator when embedded in the tab.
