# Dev Log: Issue 27.1.1.4 — Orphaned Episodes UI

## Intent (2026-02-02)
- Surface episodes that were removed from feeds but preserved because they hold user state.
- Allow users to review and delete these “orphaned” episodes (single + bulk).
- Keep behavior consistent with SwiftData persistence and iPhone 16 simulator (iOS 18).

## Spec Traceability
- Adds scenario under **Download and Sync Management** in `zpod/spec/spec.md`: “Users Can View and Manage Orphaned Episodes.”

## Design Notes
- Persistence will tag preserved, feed-removed episodes with `isOrphaned: Bool` and `dateOrphaned: Date?`.
- Sync rules:
  - When a feed omits an episode with user state → set `isOrphaned = true` and keep the row.
  - When the episode reappears in a later feed → clear `isOrphaned`, `dateOrphaned`.
  - Unsubscribe path still deletes everything (explicit user intent).
- Fetch helpers:
  - `fetchOrphanedEpisodes()` returns only `isOrphaned == true`.
  - Delete helpers: `deleteOrphanedEpisode(id:)`, `deleteAllOrphanedEpisodes()`.
- UI entry: Settings › Storage › “Orphaned Episodes”; list rows show title, podcast, badges (progress/download/favorite/archived/rating) and reason. Empty state when none.

  UI[List] --> Fetch[fetchOrphanedEpisodes()]
  UIDeleteOne[Delete one] --> DeleteHelper[deleteOrphanedEpisode]
  UIBulkDelete[Delete all] --> DeleteAllHelper[deleteAllOrphanedEpisodes]
```

## TDD Plan
1) **Specs**: Add scenario to spec.md.
2) **Unit tests (Persistence)**: orphan marking/clearing, fetch, delete, unsubscribe cascade.
3) **Entity tests**: defaults + dateOrphaned behavior.
4) **Integration test**: seed → orphan → fetch → delete all.
5) **UI tests**: navigation, list, delete single/bulk, empty state, play attempt.
6) Implement to make tests green; rerun targeted suites then full script.

## Risks / Watch
- Migration: new fields must default safely; add tests for default false.
- Dead audio URLs: handle gracefully in UI (error toast); document limitation.
- Performance: large orphan set—predicate on `isOrphaned` should be indexable if needed.

## Done / Next
- [x] Spec updated
- [x] Tests added (red)
- [x] Implementation
- [x] Targeted runs
- [x] Full pipeline
- [ ] Gap fix follow-up (2026-02-02): address playback validity handling, reason badges completeness, single-delete UI + deleteOne VM tests, and ensure orphan filtering in primary lists; keep scope tightly aligned to Issue 27.1.1.4 acceptance.
