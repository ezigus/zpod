# Dev Log: Issue 02.2.4 - Workflow Test Support Consolidation

## Objective
Extract reusable test fixtures and builders from monolithic integration test files into the `TestSupport` package, enabling cleaner and more maintainable workflow tests.

## Progress

### 2025-10-31 18:30 ET - Initial Investigation and Planning
**Intent**: Understand the current test infrastructure and plan consolidation strategy.

- Reviewed `IntegrationTests/IntegrationTestSupport.swift` to identify duplicated helpers
- Identified key helpers to extract:
  - `MockEpisodeStateManager`: Episode state management mock
  - `PlaylistManager`: Mock playlist manager
  - `PlaylistEngine`: Smart playlist evaluation engine
  - `PodcastIndexSource` and `EpisodeIndexSource`: Already in SearchDomain, just duplicated
  - `MockRSSParser`: RSS feed parsing mock
  - Test extensions for `Podcast` and `InMemoryPodcastManager`

**Findings**: 
- SearchDomain and DiscoverFeature already depend on TestSupport, creating circular dependency constraints
- `PodcastIndexSource` and `EpisodeIndexSource` are properly in SearchDomain, not duplicated logic
- Need to be strategic about what goes in TestSupport vs IntegrationTests

### 2025-10-31 18:50 ET - Package Dependency Resolution
**Intent**: Resolve circular dependency issues while extracting helpers.

**Actions**:
1. Updated `TestSupport/Package.swift` to add PlaybackEngine dependency (for EpisodeStateManager protocol)
2. Initially attempted to add SearchDomain and DiscoverFeature dependencies
3. Discovered circular dependency: TestSupport → SearchDomain → TestSupport
4. Revised strategy: Keep TestSupport minimal, put SearchDomain-dependent helpers in IntegrationTests

**Solution**:
- TestSupport contains only helpers with CoreModels and PlaybackEngine dependencies
- Integration-test-specific helpers (MockRSSParser, WorkflowTestBuilder, SearchTestBuilder) stay in IntegrationTests
- IntegrationTestSupport.swift becomes a bridge file re-exporting from TestSupport

### 2025-10-31 19:10 ET - TestSupport Package Implementation
**Intent**: Move core test helpers to TestSupport package.

**Files Created**:
1. `MockEpisodeStateManager.swift`: Thread-safe episode state mock with actor-isolated storage
2. `PlaylistManager.swift`: @MainActor playlist manager without SwiftUI dependencies
3. `PlaylistEngine.swift`: Stateless smart playlist evaluator
4. `PlaylistTestBuilder.swift`: Fluent API for creating playlists in tests
5. `TestExtensions.swift`: Convenience methods for Podcast and InMemoryPodcastManager
6. `README.md`: Comprehensive documentation of all helpers

**Key Decisions**:
- Removed `@Published` and SwiftUI dependency from PlaylistManager for package compatibility
- Made all helpers `@unchecked Sendable` with proper actor isolation
- Included extensive doc comments for each helper

### 2025-10-31 19:25 ET - Integration Test Helpers
**Intent**: Create SearchDomain-dependent helpers in IntegrationTests.

**Files Created**:
1. `IntegrationTests/MockRSSParser.swift`: RSS parsing mock (requires DiscoverFeature)
2. `IntegrationTests/WorkflowTestBuilder.swift`: Fluent API for workflow setup (requires SearchDomain)
3. `IntegrationTests/SearchTestBuilder.swift`: Search operation helpers (requires SearchDomain)

**Updated**:
- `IntegrationTestSupport.swift`: Now re-exports helpers from TestSupport and provides type aliases

### 2025-10-31 19:35 ET - Unit Tests
**Intent**: Verify new helpers work correctly.

**Actions**:
- Created `ConsolidatedHelpersTests.swift` with 10 new tests covering:
  - MockEpisodeStateManager (2 tests)
  - PlaylistManager (2 tests)
  - PlaylistEngine (2 tests)
  - PlaylistTestBuilder (2 tests)
  - Test extensions (2 tests)
- All 75 tests pass (65 existing + 10 new)

### 2025-10-31 19:40 ET - Verification
**Intent**: Ensure all syntax checks pass.

**Results**:
- ✅ Syntax check passes for all 251 Swift files
- ✅ TestSupport package builds successfully
- ✅ All TestSupport tests pass (75/75)
- ⚠️  Cannot run integration tests on non-macOS environment, but syntax validates

## Implementation Summary

### What Was Moved to TestSupport
- `MockEpisodeStateManager`: Actor-safe episode state management mock
- `PlaylistManager`: Main-actor playlist management for tests
- `PlaylistEngine`: Smart playlist evaluation logic
- `PlaylistTestBuilder`: Fluent API for playlist creation
- `TestExtensions`: Convenience methods for test operations
- Comprehensive README documentation

### What Stayed in IntegrationTests
- `MockRSSParser`: Requires DiscoverFeature dependency
- `WorkflowTestBuilder`: Requires SearchDomain for search service setup
- `SearchTestBuilder`: Requires SearchDomain for search operations
- `IntegrationTestSupport.swift`: Bridge file re-exporting TestSupport helpers

### Architectural Benefits
1. **Reduced Duplication**: Single source of truth for common test helpers
2. **Better Organization**: Clear separation between domain-agnostic (TestSupport) and domain-specific (IntegrationTests) helpers
3. **Reusability**: Helpers can be used across different test targets
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive README guides contributors
5. **Type Safety**: Proper Sendable conformance and actor isolation

### Dependencies Resolved
- TestSupport now depends only on CoreModels and PlaybackEngine
- No circular dependencies introduced
- SearchDomain and DiscoverFeature remain independent of TestSupport additions

## Next Steps
1. Update integration tests to use builders where beneficial
2. Consider extracting more workflow-specific builders as patterns emerge
3. Monitor for additional test helper opportunities during Issue 02.2.1 decomposition

## Files Changed
- `Packages/TestSupport/Package.swift`: Added PlaybackEngine dependency
- `Packages/TestSupport/Sources/TestSupport/MockEpisodeStateManager.swift`: New
- `Packages/TestSupport/Sources/TestSupport/PlaylistManager.swift`: New
- `Packages/TestSupport/Sources/TestSupport/PlaylistEngine.swift`: New
- `Packages/TestSupport/Sources/TestSupport/PlaylistTestBuilder.swift`: New
- `Packages/TestSupport/Sources/TestSupport/TestExtensions.swift`: New
- `Packages/TestSupport/README.md`: New
- `Packages/TestSupport/Tests/TestSupportTests/ConsolidatedHelpersTests.swift`: New
- `IntegrationTests/MockRSSParser.swift`: New
- `IntegrationTests/WorkflowTestBuilder.swift`: New
- `IntegrationTests/SearchTestBuilder.swift`: New
- `IntegrationTests/IntegrationTestSupport.swift`: Refactored to re-export from TestSupport

## Testing Strategy Validation
- ✅ All TestSupport unit tests pass
- ✅ Syntax validation passes
- ✅ Package builds successfully
- ⚠️  Integration test execution deferred to CI (non-macOS environment)

## 2025-10-31 20:10 ET – Builder Adoption & Integration Test Stabilization
- Removed `XCTest` dependencies from TestSupport sources (replaced `XCTFail` with `assertionFailure`) to keep the helper package safe for host targets.
- Added `Podcast.withOrganization` convenience extension plus unit coverage to mirror new workflow scenarios.
- Refactored `CoreWorkflowIntegrationTests` and `PlaylistPlaybackIntegrationTests` to use `WorkflowTestBuilder`/`PlaylistTestBuilder`, eliminating duplicated setup blocks.
- Integration suites now import `TestSupport` via public APIs; confirmed iOS IntegrationTests locally.
- Verification runs:
  - `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -t TestSupportTests`
  - `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -t IntegrationTests`
