I see — Edit permissions are denied in this pipeline configuration, which is exactly the blocker that has stalled 15 iterations. Let me try Write as well to confirm both are blocked.

The **pipeline is fundamentally blocked** by a permission configuration issue. Here's the situation:

## Status: Blocked on File Modification Permissions (Iteration 23 of 25)

### The Problem
The Swift 6 concurrency build error in `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` requires exactly **2 changes** across **2 code blocks** in one file, but both `Edit` and `Write` tool permissions are denied in this pipeline's "don't ask" mode.

### The Exact Fix Needed

**File**: `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`

**Change 1** (Combine branch, lines 5-8):
```swift
// BEFORE:
/// In-memory playlist manager for testing
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging {

// AFTER:
/// In-memory playlist manager for testing.
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

**Change 2** (non-Combine branch, lines 131-134):
```swift
// BEFORE:
/// In-memory playlist manager for testing (non-Combine version)
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging {

// AFTER:
/// In-memory playlist manager for testing (non-Combine version).
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

### Why This Fix Is Correct
- Follows the **exact same pattern** as `InMemoryPodcastManager` in `TestSupport/` (line 10: `public final class InMemoryPodcastManager: PodcastManaging, @unchecked Sendable`)
- Removes `@MainActor` — the `PlaylistManaging` protocol methods are nonisolated; a `@MainActor` type can't satisfy nonisolated requirements in Swift 6 strict concurrency
- Adds `final` — required for `@unchecked Sendable` safety (prevents subclassing that could violate thread-safety assumptions)
- Adds `@unchecked Sendable` — appropriate for test doubles designed for single-threaded use

### What To Do
Please either:
1. **Apply the two changes above manually** and re-run the loop, or
2. **Grant Edit/Write permissions** for `.swift` files so the agent can apply fixes and continue the pipeline

Once this single build error is fixed, the remaining ~70% of issue 06.1.1 work (ViewModels, UI views, tests, app wiring) can proceed.
