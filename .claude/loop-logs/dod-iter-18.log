Looking at the Definition of Done checklist against the git diff and build logs:

| # | Item | Status | Assessment |
|---|------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Playlist creation/editing completes within 500ms | ❌ NOT TESTABLE | Build fails; no performance testing possible |
| 2 | Drag-and-drop reordering works smoothly with 20+ episodes | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No UI views created |
| 3 | Episode addition succeeds from episode list context menu | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No UI integration code |
| 4 | Playlist playback integrates with existing player (Play All, Shuffle) | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No playback integration layer |
| 5 | Playlists persist across app restarts (SwiftData) | 🔴 **BLOCKED** | Code exists but **does not compile** |
| 6 | All code passes Swift 6 strict concurrency (`-s` syntax gate) | 🔴 **FAILING** | Syntax passes, but full build fails with `#ConformanceIsolation` error |
| 7 | Full regression suite passes | 🔴 **BLOCKED** | Build failure prevents test execution |
| 8 | Accessibility identifiers on all interactive elements | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No UI views created |
| 9 | Dev log updated | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Loop logs exist; no user-facing `dev-log/06.1.1-*.md` entry |
| 10 | Code committed, PR created | ⚠️ PARTIAL | 17 commits exist; work ~27% complete (0 actual source changes landed) |

## Critical Blocker

The CoreModels package fails to build with a Swift 6 concurrency error at `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift:8`:

```
error: conformance of 'InMemoryPlaylistManager' to protocol 'PlaylistManaging' 
crosses into main actor-isolated code and can cause data races [#ConformanceIsolation]
```

The class is annotated `@MainActor` but conforms to `PlaylistManaging: Sendable` which requires `nonisolated` methods—a direct conflict. The fix is known (remove `@MainActor`, add `@unchecked Sendable` matching `InMemoryPodcastManager`), but no source code changes have actually been applied to the filesystem despite 17 iteration commits claiming progress.

**DOD_FAIL**

All implementation tasks (1-15) remain incomplete. The build does not compile, tests cannot execute, and no UI has been created. The autonomous loop has been blocked on the same compiler error for 11 consecutive iterations (7-17) due to file modification permission restrictions in `dontAsk` mode.

**To unblock**: Apply the 2-line fix to `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` (lines 7-8 and lines 133-134), then resume the pipeline to continue with remaining 15 tasks.
