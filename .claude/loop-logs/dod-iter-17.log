Looking at the Definition of Done checklist against the git diff and loop logs:

## Definition of Done Assessment

| # | Item | Status | Assessment |
|---|------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Playlist creation/editing completes within 500ms | ❌ NOT TESTABLE | Build fails; no performance testing possible |
| 2 | Drag-and-drop reordering works smoothly with 20+ episodes | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No UI views created; only persistence layer stub |
| 3 | Episode addition succeeds from episode list context menu | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No UI integration or context menu code |
| 4 | Playlist playback integrates with existing player (Play All, Shuffle) | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No playback integration layer written |
| 5 | Playlists persist across app restarts (SwiftData) | 🔴 **BLOCKED** | Repository + entity created, but **code does not compile** |
| 6 | All code passes Swift 6 strict concurrency (`-s` syntax gate) | 🔴 **FAILING** | Syntax passes, but full build fails with `#ConformanceIsolation` error in CoreModels |
| 7 | Full regression suite passes | 🔴 **BLOCKED** | Build failure prevents test execution |
| 8 | Accessibility identifiers on all interactive elements | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No UI views created |
| 9 | Dev log updated | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Audit logs in `.claude/loop-logs/` exist; no user-facing `dev-log/06.1.1-*.md` entry |
| 10 | Code committed, PR created | ⚠️ PARTIAL | 16 commits exist on branch; work is ~25% complete (only 4 of 15 tasks) |

## Critical Blocker

**Swift 6 Concurrency Error** (persistent since iteration 7):
```
error: conformance of 'InMemoryPlaylistManager' to protocol 'PlaylistManaging' 
crosses into main actor-isolated code and can cause data races [#ConformanceIsolation]
```

The `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` file has `@MainActor` isolation but must conform to `PlaylistManaging: Sendable`, which requires nonisolated methods. This is a genuine Swift 6 strict concurrency conflict that prevents the entire CoreModels package from compiling.

---

**DOD_FAIL**

The autonomous loop has been blocked on the same compiler error for 10 iterations (7-17) due to file modification permission restrictions. The infrastructure code quality is solid, but the build does not compile, which prevents verification of persistence, test execution, and UI implementation progress.

**To unblock**: Manually apply the 2-line fix to `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` (remove `@MainActor`, add `final class` with `@unchecked Sendable`), then re-run the loop to continue with remaining tasks.
