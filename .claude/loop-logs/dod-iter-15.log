Looking at the git diff and the audit logs, I'll evaluate each Definition of Done item against the current state:

## Definition of Done Evaluation

| # | Item | Status | Assessment |
|---|------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Playlist creation/editing completes within 500ms | ❌ NOT TESTABLE | Build fails; no performance benchmarks possible |
| 2 | Drag-and-drop reordering works smoothly with 20+ episodes | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No UI views created; only persistence layer exists |
| 3 | Episode addition succeeds from episode list context menu | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No context menu or UI integration |
| 4 | Playlist playback integrates with existing player (Play All, Shuffle) | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No playback integration code written |
| 5 | Playlists persist across app restarts (SwiftData) | 🔴 **BLOCKED** | Repository + entity exist but **code doesn't compile** |
| 6 | All code passes Swift 6 strict concurrency (`-s` syntax gate) | 🔴 **FAILING** | Syntax check passes, but full build fails with `#ConformanceIsolation` error |
| 7 | Full regression suite passes | 🔴 **BLOCKED** | Build failure prevents test execution |
| 8 | Accessibility identifiers on all interactive elements | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No UI views created |
| 9 | Dev log updated | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Audit logs exist; no user-facing `dev-log/06.1.1-*.md` entry |
| 10 | Code committed, PR created | ⚠️ PARTIAL | 14 commits exist; PR status unknown from diff |

## Critical Build Blocker

**Swift 6 Concurrency Conformance Error** in `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` lines 7-8 and 133-134:

```
error: conformance of 'InMemoryPlaylistManager' to protocol 'PlaylistManaging' 
crosses into main actor-isolated code and can cause data races [#ConformanceIsolation]
```

**Root Cause**: The class is marked `@MainActor`, but `PlaylistManaging: Sendable` requires all methods be `nonisolated`. These are mutually contradictory.

**Required Fix** (2-line change per established pattern in `InMemoryPodcastManager`):
- Remove `@MainActor` from lines 7 and 133
- Add `final` and `@unchecked Sendable` conformance

**DOD_FAIL**

### Items NOT Satisfied:

1. **Items 1-4, 8**: Cannot test/implement UI features—build is broken
2. **Item 5**: Repository and entity created, but **code does not compile**
3. **Item 6**: Swift 6 conformance error blocks build (not just syntax check)
4. **Item 7**: Build failure prevents regression test execution
5. **Item 9**: No user-facing dev-log entry documenting the issue
6. **Item 10**: PR status unclear; work incomplete (only ~25% of 15 tasks done)

The autonomous loop is stuck due to file modification permission restrictions. The Swift 6 actor isolation error has persisted since iteration 8 and requires manual intervention or permission elevation to unblock.
