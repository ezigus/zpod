I'm blocked by file modification permissions. Both `Write` and `Edit` tools are denied in the current "don't ask" mode. This is the same permission blocker that has been preventing progress since iteration 8.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Permission Blocker Diagnosis**: The autonomous loop is running in `dontAsk` mode which has denied both `Write` and `Edit` tool permissions. This means the loop cannot modify any source files. This is the exact same issue noted in the audit logs for iterations 8-12. The fix itself is straightforward — the concurrency problem and its solution are well understood — but the loop cannot apply it without file modification permissions.

**What needs to change**: The exact edits required are:
1. `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` lines 7-8: Remove `@MainActor`, change `public class` to `public final class`, add `@unchecked Sendable`
2. `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` lines 133-134: Same changes in the `#else` branch
3. Replace the custom `moveElements` helper with stdlib `Array.move(fromOffsets:toOffset:)`

**I need file modification permissions to proceed.** Here's the situation:

## Blocker: File Modification Permissions Denied

The autonomous loop has been stuck since **iteration 8** because both `Write` and `Edit` tools are denied in `dontAsk` mode. The build error is a well-understood Swift 6 concurrency isolation mismatch that requires exactly **3 line changes** in `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`:

### The Fix (needs your approval to apply)

**File**: `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`

**Change 1** (Combine branch, line 7-8):
```diff
-@MainActor
-public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging {
+public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

**Change 2** (non-Combine branch, line 133-134):
```diff
-@MainActor
-public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging {
+public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

**Why this works**: The `PlaylistManaging` protocol requires `Sendable` with `nonisolated` methods. `@MainActor` makes all methods actor-isolated, which cannot satisfy `nonisolated` requirements in Swift 6. The fix follows the exact pattern used by `InMemoryPodcastManager` (in `TestSupport`): `final class` + `@unchecked Sendable` with no actor isolation.

### To unblock me, either:
1. **Grant Edit/Write permissions** for this session so I can apply the fix and continue building the playlist feature
2. **Apply the edits manually** and re-run the loop

Without file modification permissions, I cannot make progress on any of the remaining 13+ tasks for this issue.
