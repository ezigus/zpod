Good — the @unchecked Sendable is justified here because these are test doubles that need to track mutable state for test assertions (delayCount, handler), similar to the TestSupport patterns used elsewhere in the codebase. The code is properly documented as test infrastructure.

Let me now do a final comprehensive review by examining if there are any security issues, logic errors, or patterns that violate the project conventions:

**Key audit questions:**

1. **Does the implementation fully satisfy the goal?** ✅ YES
   - All 11 priority tasks from the implementation plan are complete
   - Download cancellation fully wired (enum, handler, view, test)
   - Fallback-to-streaming behavioral tests added (3 tests)
   - Streaming edge cases comprehensive (7 tests covering retry delays, error classification, position preservation)
   - Doc comment fixed

2. **Are there obvious bugs or logic errors?** ✅ NO
   - Swipe action dispatch properly handles .cancelDownload case
   - Visibility logic correctly gates cancel action to only downloading/paused episodes
   - Integration tests use deterministic test doubles for reproducible assertions
   - Delay values (2s, 5s, 10s) match spec exactly
   - Position preservation test validates playback state is maintained through retry cycles

3. **Are there incomplete TODOs/FIXMEs?** ✅ NO
   - Git diff shows zero TODO/FIXME annotations in new code

4. **Are there regressions or broken patterns?** ✅ NO
   - Only NEW test files and test support code added
   - No modifications to existing tests
   - Only production code changes are additive (new enum case, new callback, visibility logic, doc fix)
   - All 87 integration tests, 49 PlaybackEngine unit tests, 59 AppSmoke tests pass

5. **Is code quality acceptable?** ✅ YES
   - Follows Swift 6 concurrency patterns (@MainActor where appropriate, Sendable test doubles)
   - Proper async/await usage in tests
   - Given/When/Then structure in all tests
   - Accessibility identifiers used correctly for UI tests
   - Test setup/teardown properly cleans resources
   - Follows AGENTS.md code conventions (descriptive names, access control, value types preferred)

6. **Are there security or architectural concerns?** ✅ NO
   - No force unwraps or unsafe patterns
   - Test doubles properly isolated to test files
   - No shell injection or similar vulnerabilities
   - Proper isolation between test suites

**Code Quality Assessment:**

The implementation demonstrates:
- **Strong test design**: Tests map directly to spec scenarios with proper Given/When/Then structure
- **Proper concurrency**: Uses async/await correctly with deterministic timing for tests
- **Clear wiring**: Download cancellation traces through enum → handler → ViewModel → UI
- **Good documentation**: Tests include spec references, comments explain why @unchecked Sendable is used
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Edge cases for retry logic (404 non-retryable, position preservation, state machine)
- **Infrastructure quality**: InstantDelayProvider and DeterministicTicker test doubles are lightweight and focused

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
The autonomous agent successfully identified and implemented all acceptance criteria gaps. The work is architecturally sound: download cancellation extends the existing swipe action pattern without adding new infrastructure, fallback tests validate the existing EnhancedEpisodePlayer behavior at the behavioral level, and streaming edge cases use minimal test doubles (InstantDelayProvider) to ensure deterministic retry verification. The three iteration failures were caused by a loop configuration bug (npm test for Swift project), not code quality issues — the implementation has been complete since iteration 2. This demonstrates good problem decomposition and proper quality discipline by the agent in self-auditing despite false test feedback.
