I see — the Edit tool is denied in "don't ask" mode. This is the exact same blocker that has stalled the pipeline for 17 iterations. Let me be direct with you about what's needed.

## Build Blocked: Permission Required

The pipeline has been stuck since **iteration 7** (17 iterations ago) on a single Swift 6 concurrency error that requires editing one file. The autonomous loop cannot proceed without file modification permissions.

### The Problem

`InMemoryPlaylistManager` is marked `@MainActor` (line 7), but the `PlaylistManaging` protocol requires `Sendable` conformance with **nonisolated** methods. Swift 6 strict concurrency enforcement won't allow a `@MainActor` class to satisfy nonisolated protocol requirements.

### The Fix (2 changes in one file)

**File**: `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`

**Change 1** — Combine branch (line 7-8), replace:
```swift
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging {
```
with:
```swift
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

**Change 2** — Non-Combine branch (line 133-134), replace:
```swift
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging {
```
with:
```swift
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

This follows the exact same pattern already used by `InMemoryPodcastManager` in TestSupport (line 10):
```swift
public final class InMemoryPodcastManager: PodcastManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

### What I Need

Please either:
1. **Grant Edit/Write permissions** so I can apply the fix and continue the pipeline
2. **Apply the two changes above manually** and re-run

The entire 15-task implementation plan is blocked on this single 2-line fix. Once the build compiles, I can proceed with SwiftData persistence, ViewModels, UI views, and wiring — all the actual feature work.
