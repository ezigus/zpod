Both Write and Edit tools are denied. I need file modification permissions to implement this feature. Let me explain what's happening.

**I'm blocked by permission restrictions.** Both `Write` (to create new files) and `Edit` (to modify existing files) are denied in the current "don't ask" mode. This is a code implementation task that requires modifying 8 existing files and creating 3 new files — file editing/writing is essential.

Here's what I need permission to do:

1. **Edit** `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` — remove `@MainActor`, remove Combine branching, adopt `@unchecked Sendable` (fixes Swift 6 blocker)
2. **Edit** `Playlist.swift` — add `description` field with backward-compatible default
3. **Edit** `PlaylistEntity.swift` — add `playlistDescription` property, update conversions
4. **Edit** `PlaylistViews.swift` — upgrade to use ViewModel, add CRUD UI
5. **Edit** `ContentView.swift` — wire `PlaylistViewModel` with real episode resolution
6. **Edit** `ComprehensivePlaylistTests.swift` — add description field tests
7. **Edit** `PlaylistFeatureTests.swift` — replace placeholder with ViewModel tests
8. **Write** `PlaylistViewModel.swift` — new `@MainActor @Observable` ViewModel
9. **Write** `PlaylistCreationView.swift` — new create/edit sheet
10. **Write** `AddToPlaylistView.swift` — new episode-to-playlist sheet

Could you either:
- Switch to a mode that allows file editing (e.g., `acceptEdits` or `bypassPermissions`), or
- Approve the Edit and Write tool permissions?

Without file modification, I cannot make any progress on this implementation.
