All the analysis, planning, and code is ready — the blocker is purely permission mode.\n\n## Why I need this permission\n\nThe entire goal \"06.1.1 Core Playlist Creation and Management\" requires creating and editing Swift source files across multiple packages:\n- `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/Playlist.swift` — add `description` field\n- `Packages/Persistence/Sources/Persistence/PlaylistEntity.swift` — add `playlistDescription` field\n- `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` — fix Swift 6 concurrency\n- `Packages/PlaylistFeature/Sources/PlaylistFeature/PlaylistViewModel.swift` — new file (ViewModel)\n- `Packages/PlaylistFeature/Sources/PlaylistFeature/PlaylistCreationView.swift` — new file (sheet UI)\n- `Packages/PlaylistFeature/Sources/PlaylistFeature/PlaylistViews.swift` — upgrade CRUD UI\n- `Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/ContentView.swift` — wire ViewModel\n\n## How to unblock this\n\nYou have two options:\n\n**Option 1** (Recommended) — Change permission mode to `acceptEdits`:\nIn Claude Code settings, switch from \"dontAsk\" mode to \"acceptEdits\" mode, then re-run or continue this session.\n\n**Option 2** — Start a new pipeline with the correct mode:\n```bash\nshipwright pipeline start --issue 186 --mode acceptEdits\n```\n\nThe complete implementation plan is ready and all analysis is done. I just need permission to write/edit files to execute it.","stop_reason":null,"session_id":"782bf10d-8e36-4492-9aff-b4273b102ed2","total_cost_usd":1.2988952500000002,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":105559,"cache_read_input_tokens":628303,"output_tokens":12998,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":105559,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"},"modelUsage":{"claude-sonnet-4-6":{"inputTokens":10,"outputTokens":12998,"cacheReadInputTokens":628303,"cacheCreationInputTokens":105559,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":1.2988952500000002,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[{"tool_name":"Edit","tool_use_id":"toolu_01Cs9JmsgYftRfaPbDgiiCCq","tool_input":{"file_path":"/Volumes/zHardDrive/code/zpod/Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/Playlist.swift","old_string":"// MARK: - Manual Playlist Model\npublic struct Playlist: Codable, Equatable, Identifiable, Sendable {\n    public let id: String\n    public let name: String\n    public let episodeIds: [String] // Ordered episode references\n    public let continuousPlayback: Bool\n    public let shuffleAllowed: Bool\n    public let createdAt: Date\n    public let updatedAt: Date\n    \n    public init(\n        id: String = UUID().uuidString,\n        name: String,\n        episodeIds: [String] = [],\n        continuousPlayback: Bool = true,\n        shuffleAllowed: Bool = true,\n        createdAt: Date = Date(),\n        updatedAt: Date = Date()\n    ) {\n        self.id = id\n        self.name = name\n        self.episodeIds = episodeIds\n        self.continuousPlayback = continuousPlayback\n        self.shuffleAllowed = shuffleAllowed\n        self.createdAt = createdAt\n        self.updatedAt = updatedAt\n    }","new_string":"// MARK: - Manual Playlist Model\npublic struct Playlist: Codable, Equatable, Identifiable, Sendable {\n    public let id: String\n    public let name: String\n    public let description: String\n    public let episodeIds: [String] // Ordered episode references\n    public let continuousPlayback: Bool\n    public let shuffleAllowed: Bool\n    public let createdAt: Date\n    public let updatedAt: Date\n\n    public init(\n        id: String = UUID().uuidString,\n        name: String,\n        description: String = \"\",\n        episodeIds: [String] = [],\n        continuousPlayback: Bool = true,\n        shuffleAllowed: Bool = true,\n        createdAt: Date = Date(),\n        updatedAt: Date = Date()\n    ) {\n        self.id = id\n        self.name = name\n        self.description = description\n        self.episodeIds = episodeIds\n        self.continuousPlayback = continuousPlayback\n        self.shuffleAllowed = shuffleAllowed\n        self.createdAt = createdAt\n        self.updatedAt = updatedAt\n    }","replace_all":false}}],"uuid":"4764e8bc-35be-460a-bcee-8929a3c464d6"}
