I'm running in "don't ask" mode where Edit/Write permissions are denied. This is the **same problem** that caused 27+ iterations of no progress in the previous loop. The pipeline configuration restricts file editing, so I cannot implement any code changes.

Let me verify what tools are available to me.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**This is the exact blocker from the previous 27+ iterations**: The autonomous pipeline is in a restricted permission mode that denies file editing. The loop keeps running iterations but cannot make any actual code changes. The `test_cmd` is also misconfigured as `npm test` instead of `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -s`, causing false test failures. Both problems need the user to intervene.

I need to be transparent about this situation. **The autonomous loop cannot make progress** because:

## Blockers

### 1. File Edit/Write permissions are denied
The Edit and Write tools are blocked in the current permission mode ("don't ask" mode). This means I cannot:
- Fix the `InMemoryPlaylistManager` Swift 6 conformance issue
- Add the `description` field to `Playlist`
- Create `PlaylistViewModel`, `PlaylistCreationView`, `AddToPlaylistView`
- Upgrade any UI views
- Write any tests

### 2. The `test_cmd` in loop-state.md is `npm test` (wrong)
This is a Swift/Xcode project — there is no `package.json`. The correct test command should be `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -s` for syntax gate or no flags for full regression.

## What Needs to Happen

The user needs to either:

1. **Restart the loop with `acceptEdits` mode** (or equivalent permission level that allows file modifications)
2. **Fix the `test_cmd`** in `.claude/loop-state.md` from `npm test` to `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -s`

Without file write permissions, no implementation work can proceed. This is the same blocker that caused 27+ iterations of stalled progress in the previous loop run.

## Implementation Plan Ready

I've fully analyzed the codebase and have a clear implementation plan (13 tasks documented in the todo list). The moment file editing is enabled, I can begin implementing:

1. Fix `InMemoryPlaylistManager` — remove `@MainActor`, add `@unchecked Sendable` with lock-based synchronization (matching `InMemoryPodcastManager` and `SwiftDataPlaylistRepository` patterns)
2. Add `description` field to `Playlist` model + `PlaylistEntity`
3. Create `PlaylistViewModel` as `@MainActor @Observable`
4. Build interactive UI (creation sheet, add-to-playlist, swipe-delete, drag-and-drop reorder)
5. Wire into `ContentView`
6. Write tests and run regression suite
