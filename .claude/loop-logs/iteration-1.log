I'm blocked by file modification permissions. Both `Write` and `Edit` tools are denied in the current "don't ask" permission mode. This is the same issue that blocked the previous 27 autonomous loop iterations.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Why this pipeline has been stuck**: The Shipwright autonomous pipeline is running in a restricted permission mode that denies both `Write` and `Edit` file operations. This means no code changes can be made — the implementation phase requires file modification permissions. The previous loop iterated 27 times without being able to make any actual code changes.

## What I Need to Proceed

This is **iteration 1 of a build pipeline** for Issue #186 (06.1.1 Core Playlist Creation and Management). I've completed a thorough codebase analysis and have a clear implementation plan, but I **cannot write any code** because:

1. **`Write` tool** — Permission denied
2. **`Edit` tool** — Permission denied

These are the only tools that can modify files in the codebase. Without them, the build stage of this pipeline cannot proceed.

### What I Was Trying to Do

**Fix the critical Swift 6 conformance bug** in `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`:

- **Problem**: `@MainActor` on the class conflicts with `PlaylistManaging: Sendable` protocol conformance. Swift 6 strict concurrency treats this as an error.
- **Fix**: Remove `@MainActor`, remove `#if canImport(Combine)` dual implementation, change to `@unchecked Sendable` (matching the established `InMemoryPodcastManager` pattern in TestSupport).

### Full Implementation Plan (13 tasks)

1. Fix `InMemoryPlaylistManager` Swift 6 conformance
2. Add `description` field to `Playlist` model + `PlaylistEntity`
3. Create `PlaylistViewModel` with CRUD/reorder/duplicate
4. Create `PlaylistCreationView` (create + edit sheet)
5. Create `AddToPlaylistView` (episode addition sheet)
6. Upgrade `PlaylistFeatureView` with toolbar, swipe-delete, context menus
7. Upgrade `PlaylistDetailView` with drag-and-drop reorder
8. Update `ContentView` `PlaylistTabView` integration
9. Write tests
10. Run syntax check
11. Run targeted tests
12. Run full regression
13. Create dev-log entry

### How to Unblock

You need to either:
- **Re-run this pipeline with file write permissions enabled** (change the permission mode from "don't ask" to one that allows edits)
- **Manually grant Write/Edit permissions** for this session
- **Run the implementation manually** using the plan above

Would you like me to provide the exact file contents for each change so you can apply them manually, or should we adjust the pipeline permissions?
