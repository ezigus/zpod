I'm blocked from both Write and Bash tools in don't-ask mode. These are essential for implementing the playlist feature — I need to:

1. **Create new files** (PlaylistManaging.swift, PlaylistEntity.swift, SwiftDataPlaylistRepository.swift, ViewModels, Views)
2. **Edit existing files** (InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift, ZpodApp.swift, ContentView.swift, Package.swift files)
3. **Run commands** (syntax checks, tests, git commits)

All 15 implementation tasks require file creation or editing. Without Write and Bash permissions, I cannot make any progress on the "06.1.1 Core Playlist Creation and Management" goal.

**What I need permission for:**
- **Write tool**: To create new Swift source files and edit existing ones
- **Bash tool**: To run `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -s` (syntax gate), build verification, and git commits
- **Edit tool**: To modify existing files like `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`, `ZpodApp.swift`, `ContentView.swift`

Could you enable these permissions so I can proceed with the implementation? The plan is well-defined from the pipeline artifacts — I just need the ability to write code and run the test harness.
