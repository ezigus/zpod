# Definition of Done Evaluation

I'm evaluating the git diff against the Definition of Done checklist for issue #186 (Core Playlist Creation and Management).

## Analysis

**Current State**: The pipeline is blocked by a Swift 6 concurrency compilation error. The git diff shows 7 files changed with 1,884 lines added — **all of which are pipeline infrastructure logs and audit trails with ZERO production code changes since iteration 7**.

The build fails immediately during the CoreModels package compilation:

```
error: conformance of 'InMemoryPlaylistManager' to protocol 'PlaylistManaging' 
crosses into main actor-isolated code and can cause data races [#ConformanceIsolation]
```

## Definition of Done Evaluation

| Item | Status | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| Playlist creation/editing completes within 500ms | ❌ FAIL | **Build does not compile** — cannot measure performance |
| Drag-and-drop reordering works smoothly with 20+ episodes | ❌ FAIL | **Build does not compile** — no UI implementation |
| Episode addition succeeds from episode list context menu | ❌ FAIL | **Build does not compile** — no context menu integration |
| Playlist playback integrates with existing player (Play All, Shuffle) | ❌ FAIL | **Build does not compile** — no playback integration |
| Playlists persist across app restarts (SwiftData) | ❌ FAIL | **Build does not compile** — Swift 6 conformance error blocks compilation |
| All code passes Swift 6 strict concurrency (`-s` syntax gate) | ❌ FAIL | **Syntax passes but full build FAILS** — `#ConformanceIsolation` error in CoreModels |
| Full regression suite passes | ❌ FAIL | **Cannot run** — compilation failure prevents test execution |
| Accessibility identifiers on all interactive elements | ❌ FAIL | **No UI views created** — no accessibility work implemented |
| Dev log updated | ❌ FAIL | **Only loop infrastructure logs** — no user-facing dev-log documentation |
| Code committed, PR created | ❌ FAIL | **25 commits but ZERO production code changes** — build remains broken |

## DOD_FAIL

**Critical Blocking Issue**: Build fails due to unresolved Swift 6 concurrency error in `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift:8`. The entire feature implementation is blocked at the protocol conformance step.

**Root Cause**: `InMemoryPlaylistManager` is marked `@MainActor`, but the `PlaylistManaging` protocol requires `Sendable` with `nonisolated` methods. The `@MainActor` annotation makes all methods main actor-isolated, violating the nonisolated protocol requirement.

**Required Fix** (2 simple edits):
1. Remove `@MainActor` from line 7 (Combine branch) and line 133 (non-Combine branch)
2. Add `final` keyword and `@unchecked Sendable` conformance to match the existing `InMemoryPodcastManager` pattern in TestSupport

**None of the 10 DOD items can be satisfied until this compilation error is resolved.**
