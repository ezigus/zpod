**Why this loop is stuck**: The autonomous "don't ask" mode denies both `Edit` and `Write` tool permissions. The pipeline has been blocked on this since iteration 8 (9 iterations ago). The fix is a two-line change, but no file modification path is available.

**The exact fix needed** (2 changes in `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`):
1. **Line 7-8**: Change `@MainActor\npublic class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging {` to `public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {`
2. **Line 133-134**: Change `@MainActor\npublic class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging {` to `public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {`

This follows the exact pattern of `InMemoryPodcastManager` in `TestSupport/`.

## BLOCKED — Need File Modification Permissions

**I cannot proceed.** This is iteration 16 and the loop has been stuck on the same compiler error since iteration 8. The autonomous mode denies `Edit` and `Write` tool permissions, which are **required** to fix the build.

### The Problem
`InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` has `@MainActor` on both class declarations (lines 7 and 133). The `PlaylistManaging` protocol requires `Sendable` with `nonisolated` methods. In Swift 6 strict concurrency, a `@MainActor` class cannot conform to a `Sendable` protocol with nonisolated methods — the actor isolation conflicts.

### The Exact Fix (two-line change)

**File**: `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`

**Change 1** (Combine branch, line 7-8):
```swift
// FROM:
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging {

// TO:
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

**Change 2** (non-Combine branch, line 133-134):
```swift
// FROM:
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging {

// TO:
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

### Why This Fix Is Correct
- Follows the established `InMemoryPodcastManager` pattern (see `TestSupport/InMemoryPodcastManager.swift:10`)
- `@unchecked Sendable` is appropriate for test-only in-memory implementations
- `final` is required for `@unchecked Sendable` classes
- Removes `@MainActor` which conflicts with the protocol's nonisolated method requirements

### To Unblock
Please either:
1. **Apply the fix manually** using the two changes above, OR
2. **Grant Edit/Write permissions** for `*.swift` files and restart the loop

Once this compiles, the remaining 11 tasks (ViewModels, UI views, playlist playback integration) can proceed.
