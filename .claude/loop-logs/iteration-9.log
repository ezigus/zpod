Both Edit and Write tools are denied in this autonomous mode. This is the same permission blocker that has stalled iterations 3-8. Let me explain the situation clearly.

---

**Permission Blocker — File modification tools are not available in this autonomous mode.**

I've been stuck on this same issue since iteration 3. The root cause and fix are well understood, but I cannot apply it:

## The Problem

`InMemoryPlaylistManager` in `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` is annotated `@MainActor`, but it conforms to `PlaylistManaging: Sendable` which has nonisolated method requirements. Swift 6 strict concurrency rejects this because MainActor-isolated methods cannot satisfy nonisolated protocol requirements.

## The Fix (2-line change)

In both `#if canImport(Combine)` and `#else` branches:

**Remove** `@MainActor` and **change** `public class` → `public final class ... @unchecked Sendable`:

```swift
// Line 7-8: BEFORE
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging {

// Line 7: AFTER (Combine branch)
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {

// Line 133-134: BEFORE
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging {

// Line 133: AFTER (non-Combine branch)
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

This follows the exact same pattern used by `InMemoryPodcastManager` in TestSupport (line 10):
```swift
public final class InMemoryPodcastManager: PodcastManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

## What I Need

**Please grant Write or Edit tool permissions for `.swift` files** so I can apply this fix and continue building the playlist feature. Without file modification, none of the remaining 13 tasks in the implementation plan can proceed.

Alternatively, you can apply the 2-line change manually:
1. Open `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`
2. **Line 7-8**: Remove `@MainActor` line, change `public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging {` → `public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {`
3. **Line 133-134**: Remove `@MainActor` line, change `public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging {` → `public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {`

Then re-run this loop iteration.
