Looking at the Definition of Done checklist and the changes made:

## Definition of Done Assessment

| # | Item | Status | Assessment |
|---|------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Playlist creation/editing completes within 500ms | ❌ NOT TESTABLE | Build fails; no performance testing possible |
| 2 | Drag-and-drop reordering works smoothly with 20+ episodes | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No UI views created; only persistence layer stub |
| 3 | Episode addition succeeds from episode list context menu | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No UI integration or context menu code |
| 4 | Playlist playback integrates with existing player (Play All, Shuffle) | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No playback integration layer written |
| 5 | Playlists persist across app restarts (SwiftData) | 🔴 **BLOCKED** | Repository + entity created, but **code does not compile** |
| 6 | All code passes Swift 6 strict concurrency (`-s` syntax gate) | 🔴 **FAILING** | Syntax check passes, but full build fails with `#ConformanceIsolation` error |
| 7 | Full regression suite passes | 🔴 **BLOCKED** | Build failure prevents test execution |
| 8 | Accessibility identifiers on all interactive elements | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No UI views created |
| 9 | Dev log updated | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Audit logs exist; no user-facing `dev-log/06.1.1-*.md` entry |
| 10 | Code committed, PR created | ⚠️ PARTIAL | 15 commits exist; work is ~25% complete (only 4 of 15 tasks) |

## Critical Blocker

**Swift 6 Concurrency Error** (persistent since iteration 8):
```
error: conformance of 'InMemoryPlaylistManager' to protocol 'PlaylistManaging' 
crosses into main actor-isolated code and can cause data races [#ConformanceIsolation]
```

**Root Cause**: `InMemoryPlaylistManager` is marked `@MainActor`, but `PlaylistManaging: Sendable` requires all methods be `nonisolated`. These are contradictory in Swift 6's strict concurrency checking.

**The Fix** (2-line change per iteration-16.log):
- Line 7-8: Remove `@MainActor`, add `final` and `@unchecked Sendable` conformance
- Same change for non-Combine branch at line 133-134
- Follows established pattern from `InMemoryPodcastManager`

## DOD_FAIL

**Items NOT satisfied**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

**Primary blocker**: The autonomous loop has been stuck on the same compiler error since iteration 8 (9 iterations ago) due to file modification permission restrictions. The code does not compile, preventing:
- Verification of persistence layer
- Test execution (all test gates blocked)
- UI implementation progress
- PR readiness

**To proceed**: Either manually apply the 2-line fix identified in the audit logs, OR grant Edit/Write permissions to allow the loop to fix and continue with the remaining 11 implementation tasks.
