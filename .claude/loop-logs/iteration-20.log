## Escalation: File Write Permission Required

The autonomous loop has been **blocked since iteration 7** (now iteration 20) because both `Edit` and `Write` tools are denied in `dontAsk` mode. The audit feedback correctly identified this as a **configuration problem, not a code problem**.

### The Problem

The `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` has a Swift 6 concurrency conformance error:
- `PlaylistManaging` protocol requires `Sendable` with **nonisolated** methods
- `InMemoryPlaylistManager` is marked `@MainActor`, making all methods **main-actor-isolated**
- This creates a conformance violation that prevents compilation

### The Fix (2 changes in 1 file)

**File**: `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`

**Change 1** (line 7-8) — Combine variant:
```swift
// BEFORE:
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging {

// AFTER:
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

**Change 2** (line 133-134) — non-Combine variant:
```swift
// BEFORE:
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging {

// AFTER:
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

This follows the exact pattern established by `InMemoryPodcastManager` in `TestSupport/` (line 10):
```swift
public final class InMemoryPodcastManager: PodcastManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

### Why I Can't Proceed

Both `Edit` and `Write` tool permissions are denied. This is the **only blocker** — the entire 15-task implementation plan cannot progress without fixing this single file. The loop has correctly diagnosed this for 12 iterations but has no way to apply the fix.

### To Unblock

Please either:
1. **Apply the two changes above manually** and re-run the loop, OR
2. **Re-run this agent with file modification permissions enabled** (`acceptEdits` or `default` mode instead of `dontAsk`)

Once this file compiles, I can proceed with the remaining 14 tasks: SwiftData persistence, ViewModels, UI views, and app wiring.
