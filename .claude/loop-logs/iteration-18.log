## STOP — File Modification Permissions Required

Both `Edit` and `Write` tools are denied in the current `dontAsk` permission mode. **This is the exact same blocker that has prevented progress for iterations 7–17.** I cannot make any source code changes without file modification permissions.

### The Problem

The build fails with a Swift 6 concurrency error:

```
main actor-isolated instance method 'findSmartPlaylist(id:)' cannot satisfy nonisolated requirement
```

This affects **all 13 methods** in `InMemoryPlaylistManager` because the class is `@MainActor`-isolated but conforms to `PlaylistManaging: Sendable`, which expects `nonisolated` methods.

### The Exact Fix (2 changes in 1 file)

**File**: `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`

**Change 1** — Combine branch (line 7-8): Replace:
```swift
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging {
```
With:
```swift
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

**Change 2** — Non-Combine branch (lines 133-134): Replace:
```swift
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging {
```
With:
```swift
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

### Why This Fix Is Correct

This follows the **identical pattern** used by `InMemoryPodcastManager` in `Packages/TestSupport/Sources/TestSupport/InMemoryPodcastManager.swift:10`:

```swift
public final class InMemoryPodcastManager: PodcastManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

- `@MainActor` is removed — the protocol requires `nonisolated` methods
- `final class` — prevents subclassing issues with `Sendable` conformance
- `@unchecked Sendable` — acknowledges mutable state is safe in single-threaded test scenarios

### How to Unblock

Please either:

1. **Apply the fix manually** using the two changes above, OR
2. **Re-run this session with file modification permissions** (`Edit` and `Write` tools enabled)

Until this single file is fixed, the entire CoreModels module cannot compile, and **none of the 15 implementation tasks** can proceed. This one fix unblocks the entire pipeline.
