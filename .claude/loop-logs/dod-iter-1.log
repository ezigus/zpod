Based on my analysis of the git diff and project state:

## Definition of Done Assessment

**Status**: ❌ **NOT SATISFIED**

### Items NOT Satisfied:

1. **❌ Playlist creation/editing completes within 500ms** — No implementation exists yet; this is a performance requirement that requires actual code and testing.

2. **❌ Drag-and-drop reordering works smoothly with 20+ episodes** — No implementation exists.

3. **❌ Episode addition succeeds from episode list context menu** — No implementation exists.

4. **❌ Playlist playback integrates with existing player (Play All, Shuffle)** — No implementation exists.

5. **❌ Playlists persist across app restarts (SwiftData)** — No implementation exists; only planning and documentation have been created.

6. **❌ All code passes Swift 6 strict concurrency (`-s` syntax gate)** — No production code has been written to test. The pipeline shows `iteration: 0` and `total_commits: 0` in loop-state.md.

7. **❌ Full regression suite passes** — No code changes committed means tests haven't been run.

8. **❌ Accessibility identifiers on all interactive elements** — No UI elements have been built yet.

9. **❌ Dev log updated** — No dev-log entry exists; only pipeline artifacts (plan.md, design.md) have been created.

10. **❌ Code committed, PR created** — `total_commits: 0` in loop-state.md; no files have been staged or committed; no PR has been created.

### Summary

The git diff shows **planning artifacts only**: `plan.md`, `design.md`, `dod.md`, pipeline state files, and loop logs. The branch currently contains **zero implementation commits** and **no actual code changes**. The pipeline is in the `build` stage but hasn't progressed beyond documentation generation.

To satisfy the Definition of Done, the actual implementation must be completed:
- All 15 tasks from the plan must be executed
- Tests must pass locally and in CI
- A PR must be created and merged
- Code must be committed to the branch
