The Edit tool is blocked in `dontAsk` mode. This confirms the exact problem the loop has been stuck on for 13 iterations. Let me be explicit about what needs to happen.

---

**The autonomous loop is blocked and cannot proceed.** I need file write permissions to fix a Swift 6 concurrency error that has stalled progress since iteration 7.

## The Problem

`InMemoryPlaylistManager` in `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` is `@MainActor`-isolated but conforms to `PlaylistManaging: Sendable`. Swift 6 strict concurrency won't allow main-actor-isolated methods to satisfy nonisolated protocol requirements.

## The Exact Fix (2 changes in 1 file)

**File**: `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`

### Change 1 — Combine branch (line 5-8):

**Before:**
```swift
/// In-memory playlist manager for testing
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging {
```

**After:**
```swift
/// In-memory playlist manager for testing.
///
/// @unchecked Sendable: This test-only implementation uses mutable state but is designed
/// for single-threaded test scenarios where thread safety is not required.
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

### Change 2 — Non-Combine branch (line 131-134):

**Before:**
```swift
/// In-memory playlist manager for testing (non-Combine version)
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging {
```

**After:**
```swift
/// In-memory playlist manager for testing (non-Combine version).
///
/// @unchecked Sendable: This test-only implementation uses mutable state but is designed
/// for single-threaded test scenarios where thread safety is not required.
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

## Why This Is The Right Fix

This follows the exact same pattern used by `InMemoryPodcastManager` in TestSupport (line 10):
```swift
public final class InMemoryPodcastManager: PodcastManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

The three changes are:
1. **Remove `@MainActor`** — protocol methods are nonisolated, so conforming type can't be actor-isolated
2. **Make `final`** — required for `@unchecked Sendable` to be safe (prevents subclassing that could violate invariants)
3. **Add `@unchecked Sendable`** — acknowledges that mutable state is present but is only used in single-threaded test contexts

**Please apply these changes manually, or grant file edit permissions so I can continue with the implementation.**
