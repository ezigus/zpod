The secondary working directory doesn't have the full source tree. Both Edit and Write are denied in this session's permission mode (`don't ask mode`). This is the fundamental blocker.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Why this loop has been stuck since iteration 7**: The autonomous loop runs in `dontAsk` mode, which pre-approves some tool permissions but denies others. Edit and Write are denied, meaning the agent literally cannot modify any source files. Every iteration since iteration 7 has identified the same fix but been unable to apply it.

The fix is straightforward and well-understood — it's a 2-line change per `#if` branch:
1. Remove `@MainActor` annotation
2. Change `class` to `final class` and add `@unchecked Sendable`
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

I cannot make progress on this task because **file modification permissions (Edit/Write) are denied** in the current session mode. The build has been failing with the same Swift 6 concurrency error since iteration 7, and the fix requires editing `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`.

## The Required Fix

In `/Volumes/zHardDrive/code/zpod/Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`, two changes are needed:

### Change 1: Combine branch (line 5-8)
**Before:**
```swift
/// In-memory playlist manager for testing
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging {
```

**After:**
```swift
/// In-memory playlist manager for testing.
///
/// @unchecked Sendable: This test-only implementation uses mutable state but is designed
/// for single-threaded test scenarios where thread safety is not required.
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

### Change 2: Non-Combine branch (line 131-134)
**Before:**
```swift
/// In-memory playlist manager for testing (non-Combine version)
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging {
```

**After:**
```swift
/// In-memory playlist manager for testing (non-Combine version).
///
/// @unchecked Sendable: This test-only implementation uses mutable state but is designed
/// for single-threaded test scenarios where thread safety is not required.
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

### Why this fix works

The error is `conformance of 'InMemoryPlaylistManager' to protocol 'PlaylistManaging' crosses into main actor-isolated code`. This happens because:

- `PlaylistManaging: Sendable` — methods are implicitly nonisolated
- `@MainActor` on the class — methods are implicitly MainActor-isolated
- Swift 6 strict concurrency correctly flags this as a contradiction

The fix follows the **established `InMemoryPodcastManager` pattern** in `TestSupport/`: use `final class` with `@unchecked Sendable` and no actor isolation. This is safe because it's a test double used in single-threaded contexts.

### To unblock this loop

Please either:
1. **Grant Edit/Write permissions** for this session so I can apply the fix and continue building the remaining 13 tasks
2. **Apply the fix manually** using the two changes above, then re-run the loop
