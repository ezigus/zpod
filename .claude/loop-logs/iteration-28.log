## Permission Blocker — I Need File Edit/Write Access

I've now hit the same wall that blocked the last **20+ iterations** of the autonomous loop. Both `Edit` and `Write` tools are denied in the current permission mode ("don't ask mode"), which means **I cannot modify any source code**.

### What I Need To Do

Fix `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` — the Swift 6 concurrency conformance error. Here are the exact changes needed:

**Change 1** — Combine version (line 5-8): Replace `@MainActor` class inheriting `ObservableObject` with `final class` using `@unchecked Sendable`:

```swift
// BEFORE (line 5-10):
/// In-memory playlist manager for testing
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging {
    @Published public private(set) var playlists: [Playlist] = []
    @Published public private(set) var smartPlaylists: [SmartPlaylist] = []

// AFTER:
/// In-memory playlist manager for testing and development.
///
/// @unchecked Sendable: This test/development implementation uses mutable state but is designed
/// for single-threaded scenarios where thread safety is not required.
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
    public private(set) var playlists: [Playlist] = []
    public private(set) var smartPlaylists: [SmartPlaylist] = []
```

**Change 2** — Non-Combine version (line 131-136): Same fix:

```swift
// BEFORE (line 131-136):
/// In-memory playlist manager for testing (non-Combine version)
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging {
    public private(set) var playlists: [Playlist] = []
    public private(set) var smartPlaylists: [SmartPlaylist] = []

// AFTER:
/// In-memory playlist manager for testing (non-Combine version)
///
/// @unchecked Sendable: This test/development implementation uses mutable state but is designed
/// for single-threaded scenarios where thread safety is not required.
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
    public private(set) var playlists: [Playlist] = []
    public private(set) var smartPlaylists: [SmartPlaylist] = []
```

### Why This Fix Is Correct

- Follows the established pattern from `InMemoryPodcastManager` in TestSupport (which uses `final class: @unchecked Sendable`)
- `SwiftDataPlaylistRepository` already uses this exact pattern (`final class: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable`)  
- Removes `@MainActor` isolation that conflicts with `PlaylistManaging: Sendable`'s nonisolated method requirements
- Removes `ObservableObject`/`@Published` since this class is a test double, not a UI binding

### What Happens After This Fix

Once the build passes, I have a large amount of implementation work to complete:
1. Build `PlaylistViewModel` and `PlaylistDetailViewModel` 
2. Build creation/edit/add-to-playlist views
3. Wire `ContentView.PlaylistTabView` to real ViewModel
4. Add "Add to Playlist" context menu on episode rows
5. Connect playlist playback to queue manager
6. Register `PlaylistEntity` in `ZpodApp` ModelContainer
7. Write unit tests

**Could you either:**
1. **Grant Edit/Write permissions** so I can apply changes, or
2. **Apply the two changes above manually** to `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`?
