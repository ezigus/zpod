I'll conduct a critical audit of the autonomous agent's work on issue 06.1.1 Core Playlist Creation and Management.

## Audit Analysis

### 1. Meaningful Progress Toward Goal?

**Status: NO MEANINGFUL PROGRESS**

The agent has been stuck in an iteration loop for 17+ consecutive iterations (iterations 7-25) without making any source code changes. The git diff shows:
- 7 files changed
- **1,884 lines added** — all of which are pipeline infrastructure logs (`audit-iter-24.log`, `tests-iter-24.log`, `loop-logs/` entries)
- **Zero production code changes**

The commits show timestamps from iterations 19-25, each claiming "autonomous progress" but containing:
- Identical test output from unchanged code
- Pipeline validation logs
- Definition-of-done audit logs
- **No actual source modifications**

### 2. Root Cause Analysis

The blocker is correctly identified: **Swift 6 concurrency compilation error** in `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`.

The error is clear:
- `PlaylistManaging` protocol requires `Sendable` conformance (line 7 in the protocol)
- `InMemoryPlaylistManager` uses `@MainActor` annotation (lines 7-8 and 133-134)
- Swift 6 strict concurrency checking fails because `@MainActor` isolation conflicts with the protocol's nonisolated methods
- **The fix is trivial: 2 lines per branch** (remove `@MainActor`, add `final` and `@unchecked Sendable`)

### 3. Critical Assessment: Agent Behavior

**What went wrong:**

1. **Permission Loop**: The agent correctly diagnosed the fix in iteration 7 but lacks Edit tool permissions in "don't ask" mode. Rather than escalate or ask the user, it entered a permission-request loop.

2. **Loop Infrastructure Overhead**: Iterations 19-25 show the agent running full test suites (~1,674 lines per iteration) against unchanged code, generating 5 identical test result files. This is computational waste without progress.

3. **Abandoned Implementation**: The 15-task implementation plan (in `.claude/pipeline-artifacts/plan.md`) is comprehensive and sound:
   - Protocol extraction ✅ (already done: `PlaylistManaging.swift` exists)
   - SwiftData persistence (not started — blocked by compilation error)
   - ViewModels (not started — blocked)
   - UI views (not started — blocked)
   - App wiring (not started — blocked)

4. **No Escalation**: The agent did not:
   - Ask the user to apply the 2-line fix manually
   - Request permission elevation
   - Document the exact fix needed clearly for human intervention
   - Break the loop after 3-5 stalled iterations

### 4. Logic & Code Quality Issues

**In the identified fix itself** (lines from agent's diagnosis):

```swift
// BEFORE (causes error):
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging

// AFTER (proposed):
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable
```

**Assessment**: ✅ This fix is **correct** and follows existing patterns:
- Matches `InMemoryPodcastManager` in TestSupport (which uses `@unchecked Sendable`)
- Matches the protocol's nonisolated method signatures
- `final` is required for `Sendable` conformance on classes
- The fix is **not speculative** — the agent verified it against the protocol definition

### 5. Incomplete Work

**Blocked (not started)**:
- All 13 remaining implementation tasks
- No placeholder code, TODOs, or scaffolding left in the codebase
- No partial implementations

**However**: The comprehensive plan document exists and is well-structured. Once the 2-line fix is applied, the path forward is clear.

### 6. Regressions or Broken Patterns?

**None observed in the codebase itself**. The only damage is:
- 9,403 lines of log churn across 5 commits
- Wasted computational cycles
- **No actual regression** in source code

### 7. Code Quality of Existing Work

The previously completed work is solid:
- `PlaylistManaging.swift` protocol: ✅ Correct design (Sendable, nonisolated methods, comprehensive CRUD)
- `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` (Combine branch): ✅ Well-structured, proper change notifications, sophisticated episode reordering
- Test patterns: ✅ Proper use of `@unchecked Sendable` in test support code

---

## Verdict

**AUDIT_FAIL**

### Issues Requiring Fix

1. **BLOCKING**: Apply the 2-line Swift 6 concurrency fix to `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`:
   - Remove `@MainActor` from both branches (lines 7-8 and 133-134)
   - Add `final` and `@unchecked Sendable` conformance
   - **This is not optional** — compilation cannot proceed without it

2. **PROCESS**: The agent should have:
   - Escalated after 3 stalled iterations, not 17
   - Clearly documented the exact fix needed for human intervention
   - Avoided re-running expensive test suites against unchanged code
   - Requested permission elevation or asked the user to apply the manual fix

3. **OUTCOME**: The agent generated **zero production code** despite a clear 15-task implementation plan and comprehensive design. All remaining work is blocked until the compilation error is resolved.

### Path Forward

Once the 2-line fix is applied:
1. Verify compilation succeeds
2. Resume from Task 2 (SwiftData persistence) in the implementation plan
3. The plan is solid and ready to execute
