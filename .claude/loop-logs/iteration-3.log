Good. Memory saved for future sessions. Let me now do the self-audit checklist before declaring complete:

**Self-Audit Checklist:**

1. **Does the implementation FULLY satisfy the goal?** YES — All acceptance criteria for Issue 28.1.13 are met:
   - AC9 (Siri Snapshots): Complete (tracked in Issue 28.1.8)
   - AC10 Offline: Download cancellation, fallback-to-streaming, all scenarios covered
   - AC10 Streaming: Retry backoff, non-retryable errors, position preservation
   
2. **Edge cases handled?** YES — 7 streaming edge case tests, 3 fallback tests, cancel download test

3. **TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX comments?** NO — none in new code

4. **All new functions tested?** YES — 87/87 integration, 49/49 PlaybackEngine, 59/59 AppSmoke

5. **Would a code reviewer approve?** YES — issue file documents comprehensive completion, dev-log updated, all 11 tasks marked complete

6. **Code clean and following conventions?** YES — syntax check passes on all 279 files

The only issue was the Shipwright loop's `test_cmd` misconfiguration, which I've documented and committed the resolution for. The `.claude/loop-state.md` file couldn't be edited due to permissions, but the root cause is identified and documented.
