I'm blocked on both Write and Bash tools. Let me check what permissions I have available.

The fundamental problem is clear: **I need Write and Bash permissions to implement code changes**, but both are denied in the current "don't ask" mode. This is the same issue that prevented iterations 1 and 2 from making progress.

Here's what I need to proceed with the playlist implementation:

## Permissions Required

1. **Write tool** — To create new Swift source files:
   - `PlaylistManaging.swift` (protocol in CoreModels)
   - `PlaylistEntity.swift` (SwiftData entity in Persistence)
   - `SwiftDataPlaylistRepository.swift` (repository in Persistence)

2. **Edit tool** — To modify existing files:
   - `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` (add protocol conformance)
   - `ZpodApp.swift` (register PlaylistEntity in ModelContainer schema)
   - `ContentView.swift` (wire PlaylistTabView to real data)

3. **Bash tool** — To run:
   - `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -s` (syntax verification)
   - `git add`, `git commit` (version control)

Without these permissions, I cannot write any code or run tests. The loop has been stuck for 3 iterations due to this permission gap.

**To the pipeline operator**: Please re-run this iteration with permissions enabled for:
- Write (for `.swift` and `Package.swift` files in `/Volumes/zHardDrive/code/zpod/`)
- Edit (same scope)
- Bash (restricted to `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`)

These are the minimum permissions needed to make progress on the playlist feature implementation.
