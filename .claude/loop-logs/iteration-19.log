Both Edit and Write permissions are denied. This confirms the audit finding — the `dontAsk` mode pre-denies file modification tools, making it **impossible** for the autonomous loop to fix the build error.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Root cause of the 11-iteration stall**: The Shipwright loop is running in `dontAsk` mode, which automatically denies `Edit` and `Write` tool permissions. The Swift 6 concurrency fix requires modifying `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`, but the agent cannot write to files. This is a **configuration problem**, not a code problem — the loop needs file modification permissions to function.

## BLOCKED: File Modification Permissions Required

**The autonomous loop cannot proceed.** Both `Edit` and `Write` tool permissions are denied in `dontAsk` mode. This has been the case for **12 consecutive iterations** (iterations 7–18, now 19).

### The Fix (2 changes in 1 file)

**File**: `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`

**Change 1** — Combine branch (line 7-8): Remove `@MainActor`, make class `final`, add `@unchecked Sendable`:
```swift
// BEFORE (line 7-8):
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging {

// AFTER:
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

**Change 2** — Non-Combine branch (line 133-134): Same pattern:
```swift
// BEFORE (line 133-134):
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging {

// AFTER:
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

### Why This Fixes the Error

- `PlaylistManaging` requires `Sendable` conformance — protocol methods must be callable from any concurrency context
- `@MainActor` makes all methods main-actor-isolated, which conflicts with the nonisolated requirement
- `@unchecked Sendable` + removing `@MainActor` matches the established `InMemoryPodcastManager` pattern in `TestSupport/`
- The class is test-only and used in single-threaded scenarios, so `@unchecked` is safe

### To Unblock This Loop

Please either:
1. **Apply the fix manually** using the two changes above, OR
2. **Re-run the loop with file modification permissions enabled** (change `dontAsk` to a mode that allows `Edit`/`Write`)

Without file write access, the agent cannot make any code changes and will continue to be stuck on this same error indefinitely.
