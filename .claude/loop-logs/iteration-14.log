I'm blocked by file modification permissions. Both `Edit` and `Write` tools are denied in the current permission mode. This is the same blocker that stalled iterations 8-13.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Why this keeps happening**: The autonomous loop (`shipwright loop`) runs in `don't ask` mode which restricts file editing. The build error is a simple 2-line fix — removing `@MainActor` from lines 7 and 133 of `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` and adding `final` + `@unchecked Sendable` — but without file write permissions, no progress is possible. This is the exact same blocker documented in observations #1150, #1155, #1164, #1172, #1185.

**The fix needed** (cannot be applied without Edit/Write permission):
1. Remove `@MainActor` from both Combine and non-Combine class declarations
2. Add `final` class modifier  
3. Add `@unchecked Sendable` conformance
4. Replace the custom `moveElements` helper with stdlib `Array.move(fromOffsets:toOffset:)`

This follows the established `InMemoryPodcastManager` pattern at `TestSupport/Sources/TestSupport/InMemoryPodcastManager.swift:10`.

## To the user: I need file modification permissions to proceed

The autonomous loop has been stuck on this same issue since iteration 8 (now iteration 14). **Both Edit and Write tools are denied** in the current "don't ask" permission mode.

### What I need to fix

**File**: `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`

**Problem**: `@MainActor` on lines 7 and 133 conflicts with `PlaylistManaging: Sendable` protocol requirements. Swift 6 strict concurrency requires that `Sendable` protocol methods be `nonisolated`, but `@MainActor` makes all methods actor-isolated.

**Fix** (matches `InMemoryPodcastManager` pattern):
- Remove `@MainActor` from both class declarations
- Make class `final`  
- Add `@unchecked Sendable` conformance
- Replace custom `moveElements` with stdlib `Array.move(fromOffsets:toOffset:)`

### After the build fix, I need to:
1. Build `PlaylistViewModel` and `PlaylistDetailViewModel` 
2. Build `PlaylistCreationView`, `PlaylistEditView`, `AddToPlaylistView` sheets
3. Wire `PlaylistTabView` to live ViewModel
4. Connect playlist playback to queue manager
5. Write persistence and ViewModel tests

### How to unblock

Please either:
1. **Grant Edit/Write permissions** for this session so I can apply the fix and continue
2. **Apply the fix manually** and re-run the loop
3. **Re-run with different permissions**: `shipwright loop` with `--mode acceptEdits` or equivalent
