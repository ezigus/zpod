# Definition of Done Evaluation

Looking at the git diff showing changes from iteration 24/25, I'm evaluating whether the code changes satisfy each Definition of Done item:

## Analysis

| Item | Status | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| Playlist creation/editing completes within 500ms | ❌ | **Build FAILS** — Cannot measure performance on broken code |
| Drag-and-drop reordering works smoothly with 20+ episodes | ❌ | **Build FAILS** — No UI implementation exists |
| Episode addition succeeds from episode list context menu | ❌ | **Build FAILS** — No context menu integration implemented |
| Playlist playback integrates with existing player (Play All, Shuffle) | ❌ | **Build FAILS** — No playback integration implemented |
| Playlists persist across app restarts (SwiftData) | ❌ | **Build FAILS** — Swift 6 conformance error in `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift:8` |
| All code passes Swift 6 strict concurrency (`-s` syntax gate) | ❌ | **Syntax passes but full build FAILS** — `#ConformanceIsolation` error blocks CoreModels compilation |
| Full regression suite passes | ❌ | **Cannot run** — Build failure prevents test execution |
| Accessibility identifiers on all interactive elements | ❌ | **No UI views created** — No accessibility work possible |
| Dev log updated | ❌ | **Only loop infrastructure logs** — No user-facing dev-log update |
| Code committed, PR created | ❌ | **24 commits but zero source code changes since iteration 7** — Build remains broken |

## Root Cause

The pipeline is blocked by a **Swift 6 actor isolation conformance error** in `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift:8`:

```
error: conformance of 'InMemoryPlaylistManager' to protocol 'PlaylistManaging' 
crosses into main actor-isolated code and can cause data races [#ConformanceIsolation]
```

**The Problem**: 
- `InMemoryPlaylistManager` is marked `@MainActor` (line 7)
- `PlaylistManaging` protocol requires `Sendable` with nonisolated methods
- `@MainActor` makes all methods main actor-isolated, violating the nonisolated requirement

**The Fix** (two edits in `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`):
1. Remove `@MainActor` annotation
2. Add `final` keyword + `@unchecked Sendable` conformance

This fix has been correctly identified but cannot be applied due to file modification permission restrictions in "don't ask" mode.

## DOD_FAIL

**Critical Blocker**: Build fails due to unresolved Swift 6 concurrency error. The entire feature implementation is blocked at the protocol conformance step. None of the 10 DOD items can be satisfied until the compilation error is resolved.
