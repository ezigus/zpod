I'm blocked by the permission model. Both the **Write** tool (for creating/editing files) and **Bash** tool (for running commands, committing, testing) are denied in the current "don't ask" mode.

## What I Need to Proceed

This is an implementation task that requires:

1. **Write/Edit tools** — to create new Swift source files (`PlaylistManaging.swift`, `PlaylistEntity.swift`, `SwiftDataPlaylistRepository.swift`) and modify existing ones (`ZpodApp.swift`, `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`, `Package.swift` files)

2. **Bash tool** — to run the test harness (`./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -s` for syntax gate), commit changes (`git add/commit`), and verify builds

Without these permissions, I cannot make any progress on the implementation. The audit from iteration 1 correctly noted that "designing but not building" was the gap — and now I need file write + shell access to close that gap.

### Recommended Permission Setup

The loop should be configured with at least:
- **Write/Edit**: Allowed for `.swift` files and `Package.swift` within the `/Volumes/zHardDrive/code/zpod/` workspace
- **Bash**: Allowed for `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`

Please update the permission mode (e.g., switch from `dontAsk` to `acceptEdits` or `bypassPermissions`) and re-run so I can execute the implementation plan.
