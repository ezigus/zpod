`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
1. The iteration 1 "test failures" were caused by the Shipwright loop configuration using `npm test` as the test command for a Swift/Xcode project — a configuration mismatch, not an actual code problem. All implementation work was already done and passing.
2. The SwipeActionType extension pattern in this codebase centralizes all action metadata (display name, SF Symbol icon, color tint, destructive flag) as computed properties on the enum — adding a new action like `.cancelDownload` requires touching each computed property switch statement, keeping the data co-located.
3. The `IntegrationTests` target uses local test doubles (like `IntegrationInstantDelayProvider`) rather than importing from `TestSupport` because the Xcode IntegrationTests target can't access SwiftPM test support modules — a common pattern when mixing Xcode workspace tests with SwiftPM package test infrastructure.
