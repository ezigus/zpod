# Definition of Done Assessment

Looking at the git diff, this iteration contains **only diagnostic logs and state files** — zero source code changes to the actual feature implementation.

## DOD Status

| Item | Status | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| Playlist creation/editing completes within 500ms | ❌ NOT SATISFIED | Build fails; no UI implementation |
| Drag-and-drop reordering works smoothly with 20+ episodes | ❌ NOT SATISFIED | Build fails; no UI implementation |
| Episode addition succeeds from episode list context menu | ❌ NOT SATISFIED | Build fails; no context menu integration |
| Playlist playback integrates with existing player (Play All, Shuffle) | ❌ NOT SATISFIED | Build fails; no playback integration |
| Playlists persist across app restarts (SwiftData) | ❌ NOT SATISFIED | Build **fails** with Swift 6 concurrency error on `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift:8` |
| All code passes Swift 6 strict concurrency (`-s` syntax gate) | ❌ NOT SATISFIED | Syntax passes but **full build fails** with `#ConformanceIsolation` error |
| Full regression suite passes | ❌ NOT SATISFIED | Build failure prevents test execution |
| Accessibility identifiers on all interactive elements | ❌ NOT SATISFIED | No UI views created |
| Dev log updated | ❌ NOT SATISFIED | No user-facing dev-log entry in `dev-log/06.1.1-*.md` |
| Code committed, PR created | ⚠️ PARTIAL | 21 commits exist but **zero source code modifications** since iteration 7 |

## Critical Blocker

The autonomous loop has been stuck for **15 iterations** (7-21) on the same Swift 6 concurrency error:

```
InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift:8:57: error: conformance of 'InMemoryPlaylistManager' 
to protocol 'PlaylistManaging' crosses into main actor-isolated code 
[#ConformanceIsolation]
```

**Root cause**: `@MainActor`-isolated class cannot conform to `Sendable` protocol (which requires `nonisolated` methods).

**Proposed fix** (correctly identified but not applied):
- Remove `@MainActor` annotation
- Add `final` modifier
- Add `@unchecked Sendable` conformance

**Why it's not applied**: The agent correctly diagnosed the issue but lacks file modification permissions in the current mode. Iterations 7-21 represent repeated diagnostic work, not implementation progress.

**DOD_FAIL**

**Items NOT satisfied**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (all items)

To proceed: Either grant Edit/Write permissions to apply the concurrency fix, or apply manually to `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` lines 7-8.
