Both `Edit` and `Write` tools are denied. This is the exact permission block that has stalled progress for 14 iterations. I cannot modify source files.

**I need to stop and explain the situation clearly.**

## Blocked: File Modification Permissions Required

I've diagnosed the build failure and have the exact fix ready, but **both Edit and Write tools are denied** in the current permission mode. This is why the loop has been stuck since iteration 7.

### The Problem

`InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` (line 7-8) has:
```swift
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging {
```

The `PlaylistManaging` protocol requires `Sendable`, which means its methods are implicitly `nonisolated`. But `@MainActor` makes all methods main-actor-isolated. Swift 6 strict concurrency rejects this mismatch.

### The Fix (two changes in `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`)

**Change 1** — Combine version (line 7-8):
```swift
// FROM:
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging {

// TO:
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

**Change 2** — Non-Combine version (line 133-134):
```swift
// FROM:
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging {

// TO:
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

This follows the exact pattern used by `InMemoryPodcastManager` in TestSupport, which compiles cleanly.

### What I Need

Please either:
1. **Grant Edit/Write permissions** so I can apply the fix and continue the pipeline, or
2. **Apply the two changes manually** to `/Volumes/zHardDrive/code/zpod/Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`

Once the file is modified, I can run the build to verify and continue with the remaining implementation tasks.
