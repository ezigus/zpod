Both Edit and Write tools are denied in the autonomous loop's "don't ask" mode. This is the same blocker that has persisted since iteration 4. Let me clearly explain what needs to happen.

## Blocker: File Modification Permissions Denied

The autonomous loop **cannot proceed** because both `Edit` and `Write` tools are permission-denied in "don't ask" mode. This is the same issue that blocked iterations 4–11.

### The Fix Needed (2-line mechanical change)

**File**: `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`

**Change 1** (line 7-8, Combine branch):
```diff
-@MainActor
-public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging {
+public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

**Change 2** (line 133-134, non-Combine branch):
```diff
-@MainActor
-public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging {
+public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

### Why This Fix Is Correct

- `PlaylistManaging` protocol requires `Sendable` with nonisolated methods
- `@MainActor` makes all methods actor-isolated, which violates the nonisolated requirement under Swift 6 strict concurrency
- The existing `InMemoryPodcastManager` in TestSupport uses exactly this pattern: `public final class InMemoryPodcastManager: PodcastManaging, @unchecked Sendable` (no `@MainActor`)
- `@unchecked Sendable` is appropriate for test doubles that run in single-threaded test scenarios

### What's Left After This Fix

Once the build compiles, the remaining 30% of the task includes:
1. `PlaylistDetailViewModel` (reorder/remove/playback)
2. `PlaylistCreationView` + `PlaylistEditView` sheets
3. `AddToPlaylistView` for episode addition
4. Playlist playback integration
5. Unit tests (persistence + ViewModels)

**To unblock**: Either grant file modification permissions for this session, or apply the 2-line change manually. The loop cannot make further progress without the ability to edit source files.
