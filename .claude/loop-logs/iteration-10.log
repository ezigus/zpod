I'm blocked by file modification permissions. Both `Edit` and `Write` tools are denied in this autonomous mode. This is the same blocker that has stalled progress for iterations 3-9.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Permission blocker**: The autonomous loop agent does not have file editing permissions (`Edit` and `Write` are both denied). This means I cannot apply the 2-line fix that would unblock the entire playlist implementation. This is a tool configuration issue, not a code problem.

**The exact fix needed**: In `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`, two changes in the `#if canImport(Combine)` branch (and matching changes in the `#else` branch):
1. **Remove** `@MainActor` (line 7 and line 133)
2. **Change** class declaration to add `@unchecked Sendable` conformance

## Manual Fix Required

The autonomous agent **cannot modify files** — both `Edit` and `Write` permissions are denied. This has been the blocker since iteration 3.

### What to change

**File**: `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`

**Change 1** (Combine branch, lines 6-8):
```swift
// BEFORE:
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging {

// AFTER:
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

**Change 2** (non-Combine branch, lines 132-134):
```swift
// BEFORE:
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging {

// AFTER:
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

### Why this fix works

The `PlaylistManaging` protocol is `Sendable` with nonisolated method requirements. `@MainActor` on the class makes all methods main-actor-isolated, which Swift 6 rejects as a conformance mismatch. Removing `@MainActor` and adding `@unchecked Sendable` follows the exact same pattern used by `InMemoryPodcastManager` in TestSupport — single-threaded test doubles that declare Sendable conformance without runtime enforcement.

### To unblock the loop

Either:
1. Apply the 2 changes above manually and re-run the loop
2. Grant `Edit`/`Write` permissions to the autonomous agent
