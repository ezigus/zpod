Looking at the git diff and the Definition of Done checklist, I need to assess whether the changes satisfy the requirements.

## Analysis

The changes in this iteration consist entirely of **diagnostic logs and state files**:
- `.claude/loop-logs/audit-iter-22.log` — analysis documenting the build failure
- `.claude/loop-logs/dod-iter-22.log` — DOD assessment
- `.claude/loop-logs/iteration-23.log` — iteration narrative
- `.claude/loop-logs/tests-iter-22.log` — full test output showing build failure
- `.claude/loop-logs/progress.md` — status updates
- `.claude/loop-state.md` — loop state

**Zero source code changes** to the actual feature implementation since iteration 7.

The test output clearly shows the blocking error:

```
/Volumes/zHardDrive/code/zpod/Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift:8:57: 
error: conformance of 'InMemoryPlaylistManager' to protocol 'PlaylistManaging' 
crosses into main actor-isolated code and can cause data races [#ConformanceIsolation]
```

This is a Swift 6 strict concurrency error that prevents compilation. The fix is documented but not applied due to permission restrictions.

## Definition of Done Assessment

| Item | Status | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| Playlist creation/editing completes within 500ms | ❌ | Build fails; no UI layer exists |
| Drag-and-drop reordering works smoothly with 20+ episodes | ❌ | Build fails; no UI implementation |
| Episode addition succeeds from episode list context menu | ❌ | Build fails; no context menu integration |
| Playlist playback integrates with existing player (Play All, Shuffle) | ❌ | Build fails; no playback integration |
| Playlists persist across app restarts (SwiftData) | ❌ | **Build FAILS** — Swift 6 concurrency error on `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift:8` |
| All code passes Swift 6 strict concurrency (`-s` syntax gate) | ❌ | **Syntax passes but full build FAILS** with `#ConformanceIsolation` error |
| Full regression suite passes | ❌ | Build failure prevents test execution |
| Accessibility identifiers on all interactive elements | ❌ | No UI views created |
| Dev log updated | ❌ | No user-facing dev-log entry in `dev-log/06.1.1-*.md` |
| Code committed, PR created | ❌ | 22 commits exist but **no source code changes** since iteration 7; build is broken |

**DOD_FAIL**

**All 10 items are NOT satisfied.** The work is blocked by a Swift 6 concurrency conformance error in `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` (lines 7–8 and 131–134) that prevents the CoreModels package from compiling. The codebase cannot build; therefore, no tests can run and no acceptance criteria can be validated.

The fix is straightforward (remove `@MainActor`, add `final` and `@unchecked Sendable` conformance) and has been correctly identified across multiple iterations, but remains unapplied due to file modification permissions being denied in the current pipeline configuration.
