The Edit tool is denied in this permission mode — this is exactly the blocker that has stalled the pipeline for 17+ iterations.

## What's Needed

The build is blocked by a **single Swift 6 concurrency error** in `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`. The fix is straightforward but I cannot apply it because the Edit/Write tools are denied in "don't ask" mode.

### The Two Changes Required

**Change 1 — Combine branch (lines 5–8):**
```swift
// BEFORE:
/// In-memory playlist manager for testing
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging {

// AFTER:
/// In-memory playlist manager for testing.
///
/// @unchecked Sendable: This implementation uses mutable state but is designed
/// for single-threaded test scenarios where thread safety is not required.
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

**Change 2 — Non-Combine branch (lines 131–134):**
```swift
// BEFORE:
/// In-memory playlist manager for testing (non-Combine version)
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging {

// AFTER:
/// In-memory playlist manager for testing (non-Combine version).
///
/// @unchecked Sendable: This implementation uses mutable state but is designed
/// for single-threaded test scenarios where thread safety is not required.
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

### Why This Fix Is Correct

1. **Follows the established pattern** — `InMemoryPodcastManager` in TestSupport uses the exact same `public final class ... @unchecked Sendable` pattern
2. **Removes `@MainActor`** — eliminates the actor-isolation vs nonisolated-protocol conflict
3. **Adds `final`** — required for classes conforming to `Sendable` (non-final classes can be subclassed, breaking sendability guarantees)
4. **Adds `@unchecked Sendable`** — explicitly acknowledges manual thread-safety management for test-only code

### How to Proceed

Please either:
1. **Apply the two changes above manually** to `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`, or
2. **Re-run the pipeline with Edit permissions enabled** so the agent can apply this fix and continue with the remaining 14 implementation tasks

Once this single compilation error is resolved, the pipeline can proceed to Task 2 (SwiftData `PlaylistEntity`), Task 3 (persistence repository), and all the way through to UI wiring and tests.
