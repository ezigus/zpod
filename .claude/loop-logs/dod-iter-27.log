# Definition of Done Evaluation

Based on the git diff provided, I'm evaluating the changes against the Definition of Done checklist for issue #186 (Core Playlist Creation and Management).

## Status: DOD_FAIL

**Critical Blocker**: The build fails with a Swift 6 concurrency conformance error. Zero feature implementation has occurred.

---

## Unsatisfied Items

| Item | Status | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| Playlist creation/editing completes within 500ms | ❌ FAIL | Build does not compile — cannot measure performance |
| Drag-and-drop reordering works smoothly with 20+ episodes | ❌ FAIL | Build does not compile — no UI implementation exists |
| Episode addition succeeds from episode list context menu | ❌ FAIL | Build does not compile — no context menu integration implemented |
| Playlist playback integrates with existing player (Play All, Shuffle) | ❌ FAIL | Build does not compile — no playback integration implemented |
| Playlists persist across app restarts (SwiftData) | ❌ FAIL | Build fails at CoreModels package compilation with Swift 6 conformance error |
| All code passes Swift 6 strict concurrency (`-s` syntax gate) | ❌ FAIL | Syntax passes but full build FAILS — `#ConformanceIsolation` error blocks compilation |
| Full regression suite passes | ❌ FAIL | Cannot run tests — compilation failure prevents test execution |
| Accessibility identifiers on all interactive elements | ❌ FAIL | No UI views created — zero accessibility work implemented |
| Dev log updated | ❌ FAIL | Only pipeline infrastructure logs created — no user-facing dev-log documentation |
| Code committed, PR created | ❌ FAIL | 26 commits made but ZERO production code changes — build remains broken |

## Root Cause

**File**: `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift:8`

**Error**: `conformance of 'InMemoryPlaylistManager' to protocol 'PlaylistManaging' crosses into main actor-isolated code`

**Issue**: 
- `InMemoryPlaylistManager` is marked with `@MainActor` annotation (line 7)
- `PlaylistManaging` protocol requires `Sendable` conformance with `nonisolated` methods
- `@MainActor` makes all methods main-actor-isolated, which cannot satisfy `nonisolated` protocol requirements
- This creates a Swift 6 strict concurrency violation

**Compiler Notes** show every protocol method (allPlaylists, allSmartPlaylists, createPlaylist, updatePlaylist, deletePlaylist, findPlaylist, addEpisode, removeEpisode, reorderEpisodes, createSmartPlaylist, updateSmartPlaylist, deleteSmartPlaylist, findSmartPlaylist) cannot satisfy the nonisolated requirement.

---

## Summary

The pipeline has been stuck for **26 iterations** without any feature implementation progress. All git changes are pipeline infrastructure logs with **ZERO source code modifications**. The build is blocked by a Swift 6 concurrency isolation error that requires:

1. Remove `@MainActor` annotation from `InMemoryPlaylistManager` 
2. Add `final` keyword and `@unchecked Sendable` conformance (matching the `InMemoryPodcastManager` pattern)

Until this compilation error is resolved, **no portion of the Definition of Done can be satisfied**.
