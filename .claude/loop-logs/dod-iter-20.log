Looking at the Definition of Done checklist against the changes made:

| Item | Status | Assessment |
|------|--------|------------|
| Playlist creation/editing completes within 500ms | ❌ NOT TESTABLE | Build fails; no performance testing possible |
| Drag-and-drop reordering works smoothly with 20+ episodes | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No UI views created |
| Episode addition succeeds from episode list context menu | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No UI integration code |
| Playlist playback integrates with existing player (Play All, Shuffle) | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No playback integration layer |
| Playlists persist across app restarts (SwiftData) | 🔴 **BLOCKED** | Code exists but **does not compile** |
| All code passes Swift 6 strict concurrency (`-s` syntax gate) | 🔴 **FAILING** | Syntax passes, but full build fails with `#ConformanceIsolation` error in `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift:8` |
| Full regression suite passes | 🔴 **BLOCKED** | Build failure prevents test execution |
| Accessibility identifiers on all interactive elements | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No UI views created |
| Dev log updated | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Loop logs exist; no user-facing `dev-log/06.1.1-*.md` entry |
| Code committed, PR created | ⚠️ PARTIAL | 19 commits exist; work ~0% complete (zero source code changes since iteration 7) |

## Critical Blocker

The CoreModels package fails to build with a Swift 6 concurrency error:
```
error: conformance of 'InMemoryPlaylistManager' to protocol 'PlaylistManaging' 
crosses into main actor-isolated code and can cause data races [#ConformanceIsolation]
```

The class is marked `@MainActor` but `PlaylistManaging: Sendable` requires `nonisolated` methods — a direct conflict that must be resolved before any testing can proceed.

**DOD_FAIL**

**Items NOT satisfied**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

All 10 items fail. The build does not compile, preventing tests and feature implementation. To proceed, the `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` conformance error must be fixed first (remove `@MainActor`, add `final class` and `@unchecked Sendable`), then the remaining 14 implementation tasks can begin.
