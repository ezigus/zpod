Both Edit and Write tools are being denied in don't-ask mode. I need file modification permissions to proceed. Let me check what the current permission state is.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Permission blocker**: This is the same issue that stalled iterations 3-5. The autonomous loop is running in "don't ask" mode, which means tool permissions can't be interactively approved. The fix requires modifying `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` to remove `@MainActor` isolation — a one-line change that resolves the Swift 6 concurrency error.

**The specific fix**: Change `@MainActor public class InMemoryPlaylistManager` to `public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ..., @unchecked Sendable` — exactly mirroring the `InMemoryPodcastManager` pattern in TestSupport.

I'm blocked on file write/edit permissions. Here's what needs to happen:

## Permission Required

I need **Edit** or **Write** permission for Swift files in `/Volumes/zHardDrive/code/zpod/` to fix the build error and continue implementation.

### The specific fix needed

**File**: `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`

**Problem**: `@MainActor` on `InMemoryPlaylistManager` causes Swift 6 conformance isolation errors — actor-isolated methods can't satisfy nonisolated `PlaylistManaging` protocol requirements.

**Fix** (both `#if canImport(Combine)` and `#else` branches):

**Before** (line 8):
```swift
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging {
```

**After**:
```swift
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

**Before** (line 134, `#else` branch):
```swift
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging {
```

**After**:
```swift
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

This aligns with the established `InMemoryPodcastManager` pattern in TestSupport, which uses `@unchecked Sendable` instead of `@MainActor` for the same reason.

### Remaining work after this fix
1. Run syntax check to verify the fix compiles
2. Add persistence unit tests (audit finding)
3. Continue with ViewModel layer (Tasks 5-6)

**Please grant Edit/Write permission for `*.swift` files so I can proceed.**
