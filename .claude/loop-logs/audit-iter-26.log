I'll analyze the agent's work systematically against the stated goal and implementation plan.

## Audit Analysis

### 1. **Progress Toward Goal**

**Status**: ❌ **Zero source code progress**

The agent's changes are exclusively in `.claude/loop-logs/` directory (test logs, audit logs, error summaries) and `.claude/loop-state.md` (pipeline state tracking). There are **no changes to actual source code files** that would advance the playlist feature implementation.

**Expected Progress**: Task 1 should extract `PlaylistManaging` protocol from `InMemoryPlaylistManager`. Instead, the agent got stuck on a compilation blocker.

### 2. **Root Cause Analysis**

The agent correctly identified the blocking issue:
- `PlaylistManaging` protocol requires `Sendable` conformance (line 7)
- `InMemoryPlaylistManager` uses `@MainActor` annotation
- Swift 6 strict concurrency: `@MainActor` methods cannot satisfy `nonisolated` protocol requirements
- The fix requires removing `@MainActor` and adding `@unchecked Sendable + final`

**The problem**: The agent is trapped in a permission-denied loop. In "don't ask" mode, the Edit tool is denied, and the agent can only log findings—not apply fixes.

### 3. **Loop Analysis**

Looking at the git history and context:
- **17 iterations** of requesting the same fix
- **No code changes since iteration 7**
- **Each iteration**: analyze → identify solution → request permissions → denied → loop
- This is a classic infinite loop on a permission boundary condition

**Is this the agent's fault?** No. The agent:
- ✅ Correctly identified the root cause
- ✅ Provided exact line numbers and code changes
- ✅ Explained why the fix is correct (follows `InMemoryPodcastManager` pattern)
- ✅ Documented the blocker comprehensively
- ❌ Could not proceed without Edit permissions

### 4. **Quality of Diagnostic Work**

The agent's written analysis is solid:
- Clear identification of the Swift 6 concurrency issue
- Exact code diffs showing what needs to change
- Reference to the working pattern (`InMemoryPodcastManager`)
- Explanation of why `@unchecked Sendable` + `final` are necessary
- All documented in comments and error logs

However:
- The repeated loop suggests the agent didn't recognize the permission boundary until iteration 17
- No escalation or explicit request to the human to intervene manually
- The log files are accumulating without resolution

### 5. **Potential Issues with the Proposed Fix**

The suggested fix appears correct:
```swift
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

This matches the pattern in `Packages/TestSupport/Sources/TestSupport/InMemoryPodcastManager.swift` exactly. However:
- ⚠️ The change hasn't been **tested** yet (cannot compile without applying the fix)
- ⚠️ The fix is **only partial** — it unblocks the build but doesn't implement any of the 15 playlist feature tasks

### 6. **Incomplete Work**

The plan lists **15 tasks**. The agent made progress on:
- Task 1 (protocol extraction): 0% complete — blocked by compilation error
- Tasks 2-15: 0% complete — blocked by Task 1

The agent's entire effort has been diagnostic work, not implementation work.

### 7. **Code Quality & Regressions**

**No regressions**: No production code was modified, so no regressions are possible.

**Log hygiene issue**: The agent created 5+ large log files (1674+ lines in `tests-iter-25.log` alone) over 17 iterations without consolidating them. This creates noise but doesn't affect functionality.

### 8. **Agent Behavior**

**Positive**:
- Thorough root-cause analysis
- Clear documentation of the blocker
- Correct identification of the solution

**Negative**:
- Looped 17 times without recognizing permission boundary
- No explicit escalation request to human
- No attempt to document findings in a way that asks for manual intervention
- Accumulated debug logs instead of creating a clean summary

---

## Audit Result

**AUDIT_FAIL**

### Issues Requiring Resolution

1. **Critical Blocker — Unresolved Permission Denial**
   - The pipeline cannot proceed without fixing `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`
   - The agent correctly identified the fix but cannot apply it due to permission constraints
   - **Resolution needed**: Either (a) apply the two code changes manually, or (b) re-run with Edit permissions enabled

2. **Zero Implementation Progress**
   - 17 iterations with no source code changes
   - Agent got stuck on Task 1 prerequisite before any feature implementation
   - Pipeline stalled at diagnostic phase

3. **Missing Escalation**
   - Agent should have created a clear, explicit request for human intervention after 2-3 denied Edit attempts
   - Instead, looped silently, creating confusion about whether progress was being made

### Path Forward

To unblock this pipeline:

```bash
# Option A: Apply the fix manually to InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift (both branches)
# Then resume: shipwright pipeline resume

# Option B: Re-run with edit permissions enabled
# shipwright pipeline start --issue 186 --worktree  # (if using new session)
```

Once `InMemoryPlaylistManager` compiles, the agent can proceed with Tasks 2-15 (SwiftData entity, repository, ViewModels, UI views, integration tests).
