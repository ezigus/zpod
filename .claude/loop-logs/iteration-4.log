I understand the situation now. This is the same permission blocker that prevented progress in iterations 1-3. Let me be direct about what's happening:

## Permission Blocker — Iteration 4

**The problem**: Both `Write` and `Bash` tools are denied in this session's permission mode (`don't ask`). This means I cannot:

1. **Create new files** (needed for `PlaylistManaging.swift`, `PlaylistEntity.swift`, `SwiftDataPlaylistRepository.swift`, ViewModels, Views)
2. **Edit existing files** (needed for `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` conformance, `ContentView.swift` wiring, `ZpodApp.swift` schema registration, `Package.swift` dependency updates)
3. **Run tests** (`./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh`)
4. **Commit changes** (`git commit`)

Every single task in the implementation plan requires Write or Bash. **There is no workaround** — this is an implementation task, not a research task.

## What Needs to Change

The loop configuration needs to grant these permissions for the `build` stage:

| Tool | Scope | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Write** | `.swift`, `Package.swift` files in `/Volumes/zHardDrive/code/zpod/` | Create new source files |
| **Edit** | Same scope | Modify existing source files |
| **Bash** | `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh`, `git` commands | Run tests and commit |

## Ready State

The research and planning is complete. I've read and understood:
- `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` — full CRUD with Combine, needs protocol extraction
- `PodcastManaging.swift` — the pattern to follow for `PlaylistManaging`
- `PlaylistViews.swift` — existing UI scaffold, currently data-less
- `ContentView.swift:159` — hardcoded empty arrays to replace
- `ZpodApp.swift:87-99` — ModelContainer schema to extend
- `SwiftDataPodcastRepository.swift` — serial-queue pattern to replicate
- `PodcastEntity.swift` — SwiftData `@Model` pattern to follow

**To unblock**: Please re-run this iteration with Write and Bash permissions enabled, or adjust the loop/pipeline configuration to allow file operations during the `build` stage.
