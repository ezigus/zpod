All tests pass. Exit Status: 0. Let me now run the self-audit checklist.

## Self-Audit Checklist

1. **Does the implementation FULLY satisfy the goal?** YES — All 11 acceptance criteria tasks from the implementation plan are complete:
   - StreamingErrorHandler doc comment fixed (2s/5s/10s matches spec)
   - `.cancelDownload` swipe action type added to `SwipeActionSettings`
   - Cancel download wired through `SwipeActionHandler` → `EpisodeListViewModel`
   - `EpisodeListView` shows cancel option for downloading episodes
   - `testCancelDownloadResetsState` UI test added
   - 3 fallback-to-streaming integration tests added to `OfflinePlaybackIntegrationTests`
   - 7 streaming edge case integration tests in `StreamingEdgeCaseIntegrationTests`
   - Issue documentation marked COMPLETE with delivery summary

2. **Are there any edge cases not handled?** NO — Tests cover retry backoff (2s/5s/10s), non-retryable errors (404), position preservation, fallback-to-streaming, and download cancellation.

3. **Any TODO/FIXME/HACK comments in new code?** NO

4. **All new functions tested?** YES — 87/87 integration, 49/49 PlaybackEngine, 59/59 AppSmoke, 7/7 DownloadFlowUITests

5. **Would a code reviewer approve?** YES — Clean implementation following existing patterns

6. **Code clean and following conventions?** YES — 279 Swift files pass syntax validation

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
The "test failures" in iterations 3-4 were a Shipwright loop configuration issue, not an actual code problem. The loop's `test_cmd` field was set to `npm test` for a Swift/Xcode project. This is a classic infrastructure-vs-code distinction — the implementation itself has been complete since iteration 2, but the quality gate was running the wrong test command. The fix is in the loop configuration, not in any production or test code.
