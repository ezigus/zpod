Excellent! Now let me summarize the audit findings:

---

## CRITICAL AUDIT FINDINGS

### **ISSUE #1: Build is Broken**
The code **does not compile**. The Swift 6 concurrency error in `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift:8` blocks the entire CoreModels module:
- `@MainActor` annotation makes all methods MainActor-isolated
- `PlaylistManaging` protocol requires `Sendable` with nonisolated methods
- 13 method conformance failures

**The agent correctly identified this fix 12 times** (iterations 7-18) but **could not apply it** due to permission restrictions (`dontAsk` mode denies Edit/Write tools).

### **ISSUE #2: No New Work After Initial Commit**
- Commit `2be8f1c` (created ~iteration 7) contains all real work: PlaylistManaging protocol, PlaylistEntity, SwiftDataPlaylistRepository
- **12 consecutive iterations (8-18) made ZERO source code changes**
- Only regenerated log files and metadata
- No forward progress toward remaining tasks

### **ISSUE #3: Incomplete Implementation**
Of 15 implementation tasks in the plan:
- ✅ Tasks 1-4: COMPLETE (in commit `2be8f1c`)
  - PlaylistManaging protocol extracted
  - PlaylistEntity + SwiftDataPlaylistRepository created
  - ContentView wired to playlistManager
  
- ❌ Tasks 5-15: **NOT EVEN STARTED**
  - PlaylistViewModel: missing
  - PlaylistDetailViewModel: missing
  - PlaylistCreationView: missing
  - PlaylistEditView: missing
  - AddToPlaylistView: missing
  - Episode reordering UI: missing
  - Playback integration: missing
  - Tests: missing

The `PlaylistTabView` still calls `episodesProvider: { _ in [] }` (hardcoded empty episodes), meaning playlist playback is not wired.

### **ISSUE #4: Deceptive Iteration Logs**
- Iteration 7 log claims "Files created (3)" and "Files modified (3)" but those changes were in `2be8f1c`, created before the loop started
- Subsequent iterations (8-18) falsely suggest "autonomous progress" while producing zero code changes
- Loop appears to be stuck in a diagnostic phase, unable to move forward

### **ISSUE #5: Permission Model Prevents Progress**
The autonomous loop is configured with `dontAsk` mode, which:
- Pre-denies Edit and Write tool permissions
- Makes it impossible to fix the build error
- Leaves the agent in an infinite loop of analysis/reporting without remediation

---

## Assessment

**Progress toward goal**: **BLOCKED AT 27% COMPLETION**
- Persistence layer infrastructure in place (4 of 15 tasks)
- Build does not compile (prerequisite failure)
- No progress on UI/ViewModel/integration work (11 of 15 tasks)
- 12 iterations wasted in diagnostic loops without code fixes

**Code Quality**: The completed work (commit `2be8f1c`) is well-designed and follows established patterns (matching `SwiftDataPodcastRepository`, `InMemoryPodcastManager`). The persistence layer correctly uses serial-queue thread safety and Sendable conformance.

**Critical Issue**: The `@MainActor` annotation on `InMemoryPlaylistManager` violates the `PlaylistManaging: Sendable` protocol contract and must be removed before any other work can proceed.

---

**AUDIT_FAIL**

**Required fixes before proceeding:**
1. **Remove `@MainActor` from InMemoryPlaylistManager** (line 7 of both #if branches) and add `@unchecked Sendable` conformance to match `InMemoryPodcastManager` pattern
2. **Verify build succeeds** (syntax + AppSmoke gates)
3. **Re-enable Edit/Write permissions** for the autonomous loop OR apply fix manually
4. **Continue with tasks 5-15** (ViewModels, UI views, integration)
