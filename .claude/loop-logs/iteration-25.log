The Edit tool is denied in the current permission mode. This is the **exact same blocker** that has stalled this pipeline for 17 iterations. Let me clearly explain the situation.

## Pipeline Blocked: Permission Issue

The autonomous loop cannot proceed because **file editing permissions are denied** in the current "don't ask" mode. This is the sole blocker — the fix is a simple 2-line change that has been identified since iteration 7.

### The Fix Needed

In `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`:

**Change 1** (line 7-8, Combine branch):
```swift
// REMOVE these two lines:
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging {

// REPLACE with:
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

**Change 2** (line 133-134, non-Combine branch):
```swift
// REMOVE these two lines:
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging {

// REPLACE with:
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

### Why This Fix Works

The `PlaylistManaging` protocol requires `Sendable` conformance (matching the existing `PodcastManaging` pattern). `@MainActor` creates an actor-isolation mismatch because the protocol methods are nonisolated. The fix:
1. **Removes `@MainActor`** — eliminates the actor isolation that conflicts with nonisolated protocol methods
2. **Adds `final`** — required for `Sendable` conformance on classes (prevents subclasses from breaking thread safety guarantees)
3. **Adds `@unchecked Sendable`** — matches the existing `InMemoryPodcastManager` pattern in TestSupport, acknowledging this is a test fixture with single-threaded usage

### What To Do

Please either:
1. **Apply the two changes above manually** to `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`, or
2. **Re-run this session with Edit permissions enabled** so the agent can apply the fix

Once this compilation error is resolved, the remaining 13 tasks in the implementation plan (SwiftData persistence, ViewModels, UI views, app wiring) can proceed.
