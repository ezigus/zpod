Both Edit and Write are permission-denied in this autonomous loop mode. This is the same blocker that has stalled iterations 3-10. I need to escalate this clearly to you.

## Blocked: File Modification Permissions Required

The autonomous loop has been stuck on the **same issue for 8 iterations** (iterations 3-10, now 11) because both `Edit` and `Write` tools are permission-denied in "don't ask" mode.

### The Problem

`InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` has a **Swift 6 concurrency isolation conflict**:
- `PlaylistManaging` protocol is `Sendable` with **nonisolated** method requirements
- `InMemoryPlaylistManager` uses `@MainActor`, making all methods **actor-isolated**
- Swift 6 strictly rejects this: actor-isolated methods cannot satisfy nonisolated `Sendable` protocol requirements

### The Exact Fix (2 changes in one file)

**File**: `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`

**Change 1** — Combine branch (lines 6-8):
```swift
// REMOVE these 2 lines:
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging {

// REPLACE with:
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: ObservableObject, PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

**Change 2** — non-Combine branch (lines 132-134):
```swift
// REMOVE these 2 lines:
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
@MainActor
public class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging {

// REPLACE with:
@available(macOS 10.15, *)
public final class InMemoryPlaylistManager: PlaylistManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

### Why This Is Correct

This follows the **exact same pattern** used by `InMemoryPodcastManager` in TestSupport (line 10):
```swift
public final class InMemoryPodcastManager: PodcastManaging, @unchecked Sendable {
```

- Removes `@MainActor` so methods are nonisolated (matching protocol requirements)
- Adds `@unchecked Sendable` to satisfy the `Sendable` requirement without compiler verification (acceptable for test doubles)
- Adds `final` for consistency with the established pattern

### What This Unblocks

Once this 2-line fix compiles, the entire playlist infrastructure is wired and functional:
- PlaylistManaging protocol + SwiftData persistence
- ContentView wired to live playlist data
- App-level dependency injection complete

The remaining tasks from the implementation plan (ViewModels, creation/edit UI, episode addition, playback integration) can then proceed.

**Please either apply this fix manually or grant Edit/Write permissions so the loop can continue.**
