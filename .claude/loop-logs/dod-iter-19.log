Looking at the Definition of Done checklist against the git diff and build logs:

## Analysis

| # | Item | Status | Assessment |
|---|------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Playlist creation/editing completes within 500ms | ❌ NOT TESTABLE | Build fails; no performance testing possible |
| 2 | Drag-and-drop reordering works smoothly with 20+ episodes | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No UI views created |
| 3 | Episode addition succeeds from episode list context menu | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No UI integration code |
| 4 | Playlist playback integrates with existing player (Play All, Shuffle) | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No playback integration layer |
| 5 | Playlists persist across app restarts (SwiftData) | 🔴 **BLOCKED** | Code exists but **does not compile** |
| 6 | All code passes Swift 6 strict concurrency (`-s` syntax gate) | 🔴 **FAILING** | Syntax passes, but full build fails with `#ConformanceIsolation` error |
| 7 | Full regression suite passes | 🔴 **BLOCKED** | Build failure prevents test execution |
| 8 | Accessibility identifiers on all interactive elements | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No UI views created |
| 9 | Dev log updated | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Loop logs exist; no user-facing `dev-log/06.1.1-*.md` entry |
| 10 | Code committed, PR created | ⚠️ PARTIAL | 18 commits exist; work ~27% complete (0 actual source changes in loops 8-18) |

## Critical Blocker

The CoreModels package fails to build with a Swift 6 concurrency error at `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift:8`:

```
error: conformance of 'InMemoryPlaylistManager' to protocol 'PlaylistManaging' 
crosses into main actor-isolated code and can cause data races [#ConformanceIsolation]
```

The class is annotated `@MainActor` but conforms to `PlaylistManaging: Sendable` which requires nonisolated methods — a direct conflict.

**Required fix** (2 lines in 1 file):
- Remove `@MainActor` annotation from lines 7 and 133
- Add `@unchecked Sendable` conformance (following `InMemoryPodcastManager` pattern)

---

**DOD_FAIL**

**Items NOT satisfied**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

All implementation tasks remain incomplete. The build does not compile, tests cannot execute, and no UI has been created. To proceed, apply the Swift 6 concurrency fix to `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`, verify the build succeeds, then resume implementation of remaining tasks 5-15 (ViewModels, UI views, integration, tests).
