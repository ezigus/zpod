Based on the git diff showing the current state (iteration 14 with permission blockers), I'll evaluate each Definition of Done item:

## Definition of Done Evaluation

| # | Item | Status | Assessment |
|---|------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Playlist creation/editing completes within 500ms | ❌ NOT TESTED | No performance benchmarks possible; build fails |
| 2 | Drag-and-drop reordering works smoothly with 20+ episodes | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No UI views created; only persistence infrastructure exists |
| 3 | Episode addition succeeds from episode list context menu | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No context menu or UI flow implemented |
| 4 | Playlist playback integrates with existing player (Play All, Shuffle) | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No playback integration code written |
| 5 | Playlists persist across app restarts (SwiftData) | 🔴 **BLOCKED** | Repository and entity exist but **code doesn't compile** |
| 6 | All code passes Swift 6 strict concurrency (`-s` syntax gate) | 🔴 **FAILING** | Syntax check passes, but full build fails with conformance error |
| 7 | Full regression suite passes | 🔴 **BLOCKED** | Build failure prevents test execution |
| 8 | Accessibility identifiers on all interactive elements | ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED | No UI views created |
| 9 | Dev log updated | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Loop logs exist; no user-facing `dev-log/06.1.1-*.md` entry |
| 10 | Code committed, PR created | ⚠️ PARTIAL | 13 commits exist; PR status unclear from diff |

## Critical Blocker

**Swift 6 Concurrency Conformance Error** in `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift:8:57`:

```
error: conformance of 'InMemoryPlaylistManager' to protocol 'PlaylistManaging' 
crosses into main actor-isolated code and can cause data races
```

The class is marked `@MainActor` (lines 7 & 133), but `PlaylistManaging` protocol requires `Sendable` with `nonisolated` methods. This is a fundamental isolation mismatch.

**Fix required** (2-line change matching `InMemoryPodcastManager` pattern):
- Remove `@MainActor` from both conditional branches
- Add `final` and `@unchecked Sendable` conformance

---

## Result

**DOD_FAIL**

The work represents ~25% completion with strong architectural foundation (persistence layer, protocol, repository), but:
- **Build is broken** (Swift 6 conformance violation)
- **Core features incomplete** (no ViewModels, UI, playback integration, or tests)
- **Cannot unblock** without file modification permissions or manual fix application

The autonomous loop is stuck due to permission constraints. **Immediate action needed**: Apply the 2-line Swift 6 fix to `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` to unblock compilation and resume remaining tasks.
