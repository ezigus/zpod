Looking at the Definition of Done checklist against the code changes shown in the git diff:

## DOD Assessment

| Item | Status | Assessment |
|------|--------|------------|
| Playlist creation/editing completes within 500ms | ❌ NOT SATISFIED | Build fails; performance cannot be tested |
| Drag-and-drop reordering works smoothly with 20+ episodes | ❌ NOT SATISFIED | No UI implementation; build failure blocks testing |
| Episode addition succeeds from episode list context menu | ❌ NOT SATISFIED | No context menu integration implemented |
| Playlist playback integrates with existing player (Play All, Shuffle) | ❌ NOT SATISFIED | No playback integration layer implemented |
| Playlists persist across app restarts (SwiftData) | ❌ NOT SATISFIED | Code exists but **build fails with Swift 6 concurrency error** |
| All code passes Swift 6 strict concurrency (`-s` syntax gate) | ❌ NOT SATISFIED | **Syntax passes, but full build fails** with `#ConformanceIsolation` error in `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift:8` |
| Full regression suite passes | ❌ NOT SATISFIED | Build failure prevents test execution |
| Accessibility identifiers on all interactive elements | ❌ NOT SATISFIED | No UI views created |
| Dev log updated | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Loop logs exist (audit/dod/iteration logs) but no user-facing dev-log entry in `dev-log/06.1.1-*.md` |
| Code committed, PR created | ⚠️ PARTIAL | 20 commits exist but **zero source code changes since iteration 7** — only diagnostic logs |

## Critical Blocker

The `InMemoryPlaylistManager` class is marked `@MainActor` but conforms to `PlaylistManaging: Sendable`, which requires `nonisolated` methods. Swift 6 strict concurrency prevents main-actor-isolated methods from satisfying nonisolated protocol requirements.

**Error output (from build log)**:
```
error: conformance of 'InMemoryPlaylistManager' to protocol 'PlaylistManaging' 
crosses into main actor-isolated code and can cause data races [#ConformanceIsolation]
```

This prevents the entire CoreModels package from compiling.

**DOD_FAIL**

**Items NOT satisfied**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (all items)

**Root cause**: Build does not compile due to Swift 6 concurrency isolation error. The loop correctly identified the fix but cannot apply it due to permission restrictions (`dontAsk` mode).

To proceed, the `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` file must be modified to:
1. Remove `@MainActor` annotation
2. Add `final class` modifier
3. Add `@unchecked Sendable` conformance

Once this blocker is resolved, the remaining 14 implementation tasks can begin.
