Looking at the Definition of Done checklist against the changes made in this iteration:

| Item | Status | Assessment |
|------|--------|------------|
| Playlist creation/editing completes within 500ms | ❌ | **Build fails** — Cannot measure performance on broken code |
| Drag-and-drop reordering works smoothly with 20+ episodes | ❌ | **Build fails** — No UI implementation exists |
| Episode addition succeeds from episode list context menu | ❌ | **Build fails** — No context menu integration implemented |
| Playlist playback integrates with existing player (Play All, Shuffle) | ❌ | **Build fails** — No playback integration implemented |
| Playlists persist across app restarts (SwiftData) | ❌ | **Build FAILS** with Swift 6 concurrency error in `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift:8` |
| All code passes Swift 6 strict concurrency (`-s` syntax gate) | ❌ | **Syntax passes but full build FAILS** — `#ConformanceIsolation` error blocks compilation |
| Full regression suite passes | ❌ | **Cannot run** — Build failure prevents test execution |
| Accessibility identifiers on all interactive elements | ❌ | **No UI views created** — No accessibility work possible |
| Dev log updated | ❌ | **No user-facing dev-log** — Only loop infrastructure logs added |
| Code committed, PR created | ❌ | **23 commits but zero source code changes since iteration 7** — Build is broken |

**DOD_FAIL**

**Critical blocker**: The Swift 6 `#ConformanceIsolation` error in `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift:8` prevents the CoreModels package from compiling. The codebase cannot build, making it impossible to validate any acceptance criteria or run tests.

**Root cause**: `InMemoryPlaylistManager` is marked `@MainActor` but conforms to `PlaylistManaging` protocol which requires `Sendable` with nonisolated methods. These isolation requirements are incompatible.

**Required fix**: Two file edits (both in `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift`) to remove `@MainActor` and add `final` + `@unchecked Sendable` conformance. This has been identified correctly but remains unapplied due to file modification permission restrictions in the current pipeline configuration.

**Status**: The entire feature implementation (15-task plan) is blocked on this 2-line fix. None of the 10 DOD items can be satisfied until the build compiles.
