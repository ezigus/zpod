Looking at the Definition of Done checklist against the changes made, I need to evaluate each item:

## Definition of Done Analysis

**1. Playlist creation/editing completes within 500ms**
- ❌ NOT SATISFIED: No performance testing or benchmarks provided. The swift files compile (when fixed), but no timing validation exists.

**2. Drag-and-drop reordering works smoothly with 20+ episodes**
- ❌ NOT SATISFIED: Only protocol/infrastructure implemented. No UI or interaction tests exist.

**3. Episode addition succeeds from episode list context menu**
- ❌ NOT SATISFIED: Only model layer and persistence. No UI context menu implementation.

**4. Playlist playback integrates with existing player (Play All, Shuffle)**
- ❌ NOT SATISFIED: No playback integration implemented yet. Only CRUD layer exists.

**5. Playlists persist across app restarts (SwiftData)**
- ⚠️ PARTIAL: `SwiftDataPlaylistRepository` and `PlaylistEntity` created, registered in `ZpodApp.modelContainer`, but **BUILD FAILS** so persistence cannot be verified.

**6. All code passes Swift 6 strict concurrency (`-s` syntax gate)**
- ❌ **CRITICAL FAILURE**: Build fails with 5 Swift 6 concurrency isolation errors in `InMemoryPlaylistManager.swift` at lines 8, 134 (and duplicates). The `@MainActor` annotation on the class violates the nonisolated `PlaylistManaging` protocol requirements.
```
error: conformance of 'InMemoryPlaylistManager' to protocol 'PlaylistManaging' 
crosses into main actor-isolated code and can cause data races
```

**7. Full regression suite passes**
- ❌ NOT SATISFIED: Build fails, so tests cannot run.

**8. Accessibility identifiers on all interactive elements**
- ❌ NOT SATISFIED: No UI elements exist yet (only model/persistence layer).

**9. Dev log updated**
- ⚠️ PARTIAL: Loop logs show progress but `.claude/loop-logs/iteration-8.log` documents the permission blocker. No user-facing dev-log update in `dev-log/*.md`.

**10. Code committed, PR created**
- ✅ SATISFIED: Commit `1e4f9d8` exists with message "loop: iteration 7 — autonomous progress"

---

## Summary

**DOD_FAIL**

The changes **do NOT satisfy** the Definition of Done. Most critically:

1. **BLOCKING**: Swift 6 strict concurrency build failure prevents any validation of the code
2. **Incomplete**: Only infrastructure (protocol, persistence, app wiring) — no UI, ViewModel, or integration
3. **Untestable**: No tests exist for the new code; build failure prevents regression suite
4. **Missing components**: Playback integration, context menus, performance validation, accessibility all pending

**Next steps** (already identified in audit logs):
- Fix Swift 6 conformance isolation: Change `@MainActor` to `@unchecked Sendable` on `InMemoryPlaylistManager` (matches `InMemoryPodcastManager` pattern)
- Add persistence unit tests
- Implement ViewModel layer (Tasks 5-6)
- Build UI and integration (Tasks 7+)
