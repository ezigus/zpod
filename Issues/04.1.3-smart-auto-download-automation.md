# Issue 04.1.3: Smart Auto-Download and Automation

## Priority
Medium

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement intelligent automatic download configuration with per-podcast rules, network preferences, smart cleanup policies, and iOS Shortcuts integration. This provides users with sophisticated automation capabilities to manage downloads without manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Smart Auto-Download Configuration and Rules
- **Given** I want to configure intelligent automatic downloads
- **When** I access download settings and automation
- **Then** I should be able to enable/disable auto-download per podcast with granular control
- **And** I should be able to set download quality preferences (high/medium/low) with size estimates
- **And** I should be able to configure network preferences (WiFi-only, cellular limits, roaming restrictions)
- **And** I should be able to set smart cleanup rules (keep latest N episodes, delete after X days, remove completed episodes)
- **And** I should be able to create time-based download schedules and location-based triggers

#### Scenario 2: iOS Shortcuts and Automation Integration for Downloads
- **Given** I want to automate download workflows and integrate with other apps
- **When** I set up iOS Shortcuts for download management
- **Then** I should be able to create shortcuts for common download operations (download latest episodes, clear storage)
- **And** Location-based automation should trigger downloads when I arrive at specific places (home, office)
- **And** Time-based automation should handle download scheduling during optimal periods
- **And** Shortcuts should integrate with other productivity apps for comprehensive workflow automation
- **And** Siri voice commands should control download operations hands-free

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Auto-Download Configuration (Week 1)
1. **Per-Podcast Auto-Download Rules**
   - Create granular per-podcast auto-download settings interface
   - Implement quality preference selection with storage impact visualization
   - Add network condition preferences (WiFi, cellular, roaming)
   - Create intelligent download scheduling based on user patterns

2. **Smart Cleanup Policies**
   - Implement configurable retention policies with multiple criteria
   - Add predictive cleanup based on storage pressure and listening patterns
   - Create episode lifecycle management (keep latest N, age-based deletion)
   - Add completion-based cleanup with user preferences

### Phase 2: iOS Automation Integration (Week 2)
1. **iOS Shortcuts Integration**
   - Create comprehensive Shortcuts actions for download management
   - Implement location-based automation triggers for downloads
   - Add time-based scheduling with optimal network condition detection
   - Create workflow integration with other productivity and media apps

2. **Siri and Voice Control**
   - Implement Siri voice commands for download operations
   - Add voice-controlled download scheduling and management
   - Create intelligent voice response for download status and control
   - Add hands-free download automation for accessibility

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Issue #04 (Download Core backend functionality)
- **Required**: Issue #04.1.1 (Core download progress interface)
- **Required**: Issue #05 (Settings framework for automation preferences)
- **Recommended**: iOS Shortcuts framework integration

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Time Estimate**: 2 weeks  
**Story Points**: 12

## Success Metrics
- Auto-download rules execute consistently without missing episodes
- iOS Shortcuts automation works reliably in 95% of trigger scenarios
- Siri voice commands have >90% recognition accuracy for download operations
- Smart cleanup policies reduce manual storage management by 80%
