# Issue 05.1.4: Privacy, Security, and Backup Settings

## Priority
Medium

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement comprehensive privacy protection, security controls, and backup management settings with iCloud integration, data export capabilities, and granular privacy controls. This ensures user data is protected and manageable according to their preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Security and Privacy Protection
- **Given** I want to secure app access and manage privacy
- **When** I access security and privacy settings
- **Then** I should be able to enable Face ID, Touch ID, or passcode protection for app access
- **And** I should be able to configure when authentication is required (app launch, settings changes)
- **And** I should be able to clear search history, listening history, and cached data
- **And** I should be able to manage data sharing and analytics preferences
- **And** All privacy controls should be clearly explained and granular

#### Scenario 2: Cloud Backup and Cross-Device Sync
- **Given** I want to sync settings and data across devices
- **When** I configure cloud backup in settings
- **Then** I should be able to sign in with Apple ID for iCloud sync
- **And** I should be able to choose which data to sync (settings, subscriptions, playback progress)
- **And** I should see sync status indicators and manual sync triggers
- **And** Data should be backed up automatically and restored on new devices
- **And** Conflicts should be resolved intelligently with user options when needed

#### Scenario 3: Local and Cloud Backup Management
- **Given** I want to create backups of my app data
- **When** I access backup and restore settings
- **Then** I should be able to create local backups to device storage or iCloud
- **And** I should be able to restore settings and subscriptions from backup files
- **And** I should be able to schedule automatic backups with configurable frequency
- **And** Backup should include subscriptions, settings, playlists, and listening history
- **And** I should see backup status, file sizes, and restore point options

#### Scenario 4: Apple ID Integration and iCloud Sync
- **Given** I want to sync settings and data across my Apple devices
- **When** I sign in with Apple ID and enable iCloud sync
- **Then** Settings, subscriptions, and preferences should sync automatically across all devices
- **And** I should be able to choose which data categories to sync
- **And** Sync should handle offline changes and resolve conflicts intelligently
- **And** I should see sync status and be able to trigger manual sync when needed

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Security and Privacy Controls (Week 1)
1. **Authentication and Security**
   - Implement biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID) and passcode protection
   - Create configurable authentication timing (app launch, settings access)
   - Add security settings with clear explanations and granular controls
   - Create privacy dashboard showing data collection and usage

2. **Data Privacy Management**
   - Implement comprehensive data clearing tools (history, cache, analytics)
   - Add granular privacy controls for data sharing and analytics
   - Create privacy policy integration and consent management
   - Add data retention policy configuration

### Phase 2: Backup and Sync Management (Week 2)
1. **iCloud Integration and Sync**
   - Implement Apple ID sign-in and iCloud sync configuration
   - Create selective data sync categories (settings, subscriptions, progress)
   - Add sync status monitoring and manual sync controls
   - Create intelligent conflict resolution with user decision options

2. **Backup and Restore System**
   - Implement local and cloud backup creation and management
   - Add backup scheduling with configurable frequency options
   - Create comprehensive backup content (subscriptions, settings, playlists, history)
   - Add backup restoration with verification and rollback capabilities

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Issue #05 (Settings Core backend functionality)
- **Required**: Issue #05.1.1 (Core settings navigation)
- **Required**: iCloud and CloudKit integration
- **Recommended**: Issue #24 (Data export for backup functionality)

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Time Estimate**: 2 weeks  
**Story Points**: 13

## Success Metrics
- Biometric authentication works reliably for 99% of authentication attempts
- iCloud sync completes within 30 seconds for settings and preferences
- Backup creation and restoration succeed without data loss in 100% of operations
- Privacy controls provide clear understanding and control over data usage
