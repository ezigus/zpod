## Priority
Medium

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement comprehensive organization features for managing large podcast subscription libraries, including folder creation, categorization, and advanced organization tools.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Organize Podcasts into Folders and Categories
- **Given** I have multiple podcasts in my library
- **When** I create folders or assign categories to podcasts
- **Then** I should be able to view, filter, and manage podcasts by folder/category
- **And** Folders should support nested organization and custom naming
- **And** I should be able to move podcasts between folders using drag and drop
- **And** Folder organization should sync across devices if cloud sync is enabled

#### Scenario 2: Per-Podcast Update Frequency and Settings
- **Given** I want to control how often a podcast feed is updated
- **When** I access per-podcast settings from podcast details
- **Then** I should be able to set custom update intervals for specific podcasts
- **And** I should be able to override global settings for auto-download, playback speed, and notifications
- **And** I should see clear indicators when settings differ from global defaults
- **And** I should be able to reset to global defaults easily

#### Scenario 3: Bulk Operations and Management
- **Given** I have a large subscription library requiring bulk management
- **When** I select multiple podcasts for bulk operations
- **Then** I should be able to apply folder assignments to multiple podcasts at once
- **And** I should be able to bulk update settings for multiple podcasts
- **And** I should be able to bulk unsubscribe or archive podcasts
- **And** Bulk operations should provide progress feedback and undo functionality

#### Scenario 4: Smart Collections and Auto-Organization
- **Given** I want automated organization of my podcast library
- **When** I create smart collections based on criteria
- **Then** Podcasts should automatically organize based on genre, update frequency, or custom rules
- **And** Smart collections should update automatically as new podcasts are added
- **And** I should be able to create complex rules combining multiple criteria
- **And** Smart collections should be editable and deletable with clear feedback

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Basic Organization Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. **Folder Creation and Management**
   - Create folder creation and editing interface with validation
   - Implement drag-and-drop organization with visual feedback
   - Add nested folder support with breadcrumb navigation
   - Create folder deletion with safety checks and content handling

2. **Per-Podcast Settings Override**
   - Implement per-podcast settings interface with clear inheritance indicators
   - Add settings override logic with cascade from global defaults
   - Create settings reset functionality with confirmation
   - Add settings comparison view showing differences from defaults

### Phase 2: Advanced Organization Features (Week 2)
1. **Bulk Operations Interface**
   - Create multi-selection interface for podcast management
   - Implement bulk folder assignment with preview and confirmation
   - Add bulk settings changes with validation and rollback
   - Create progress tracking for long-running bulk operations

2. **Smart Collections and Automation**
   - Implement smart collection creation with rule builder interface
