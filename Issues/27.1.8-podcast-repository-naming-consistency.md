# Issue 27.1.8: Podcast Repository Naming Consistency

**Status**: Open
**Priority**: P3 - Low
**Created**: 2026-01-17
**Category**: Code Quality / Naming

## Description
Standardize persistence naming by renaming podcast storage implementations to use "Repository" rather than "Manager".

## Problem Statement
The persistence layer mixes "Manager" and "Repository" terminology (e.g., `SwiftDataPodcastManager`) while issue 27.1 and related docs refer to "PodcastRepository". This inconsistency makes it harder to reason about architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Rename `SwiftDataPodcastManager` to `SwiftDataPodcastRepository` (or `PodcastRepository` if unambiguous)
- [ ] Rename `InMemoryPodcastManager` to `InMemoryPodcastRepository`
- [ ] Update protocol or typealiases as needed to keep `PodcastManaging` stable
- [ ] Update call sites and documentation references
- [ ] Full regression passes (`./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh`)

## Spec References
- `zpod/spec/spec.md` (architecture layering expectations)
- `Issues/27.1-podcast-persistence-architecture.md`

## Dependencies
- Related: Issue 27.1.6 (move persistence to package)
- Related: Issue 30.1 (async protocol migration)

## Testing Strategy
- Full regression: `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh`
