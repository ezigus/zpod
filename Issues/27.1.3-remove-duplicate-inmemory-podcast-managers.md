# Issue 27.1.3: Remove Duplicate InMemoryPodcastManager Implementations

**Status**: 🆕 NEW (Blocked by 27.2)
**Priority**: P1 - Technical Debt Cleanup
**Created**: 2026-01-02
**Blocked By**: Issue 27.2 (zpod app migration)
**Category**: Code Cleanup / Technical Debt

## Description

Remove the duplicate `InMemoryPodcastManager` implementation from `zpod/Controllers/PodcastManager.swift` after the production app has been migrated to use the persistent `PodcastRepository`. Consolidate test code into a single location in the TestSupport package.

## Problem Statement

**Current State**:
There are TWO nearly identical `InMemoryPodcastManager` implementations:

1. **Production location** (shouldn't be here):
   - `zpod/Controllers/PodcastManager.swift` (142 lines)
   - Comment says: *"In-memory implementation suitable for early development & unit testing"*
   - Used by production app currently (technical debt)

2. **Test location** (correct location):
   - `Packages/TestSupport/Sources/TestSupport/InMemoryPodcastManager.swift`
   - Used by test targets

**Problems**:
- ❌ Code duplication (maintenance burden)
- ❌ Confusion about which implementation to use
- ❌ Risk of divergence between implementations
- ❌ Production code in zpod/Controllers/ that's actually test infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Delete `zpod/Controllers/PodcastManager.swift` entirely
- [ ] Verify NO production code references this file
- [ ] Ensure TestSupport implementation is comprehensive:
  - [ ] Includes Siri snapshot persistence
  - [ ] Includes organization methods (folder, tag filtering)
  - [ ] Includes playback position reset for UI tests
- [ ] Update all test targets to use `TestSupport.InMemoryPodcastManager`:
  - [ ] `AppSmokeTests`
  - [ ] `zpodUITests`
  - [ ] `IntegrationTests`
  - [ ] Package tests (DiscoverFeatureTests, etc.)
- [ ] Update any documentation referencing the old location
- [ ] All regression tests pass
- [ ] Clean build with no orphaned references

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Verify Production Migration Complete

**Prerequisite**: Issue 27.2 must be complete (zpod app using PodcastRepository).

Verify no production references:
```bash
# Search for references to zpod/Controllers/PodcastManager
grep -r "Controllers/PodcastManager" zpod/ --include="*.swift"
grep -r "InMemoryPodcastManager" zpod/ --include="*.swift" --exclude-dir=Controllers

# Should return NO results (except in test files)
```

### 2. Compare Implementations

Before deleting, verify TestSupport version has all features:

**Features in zpod/Controllers/PodcastManager.swift**:
- ✅ Basic CRUD (all, find, add, update, remove)
- ✅ Organization filtering (findByFolder, findByTag, findUnorganized)
- ✅ Recursive folder queries (findByFolderRecursive)
- ✅ Siri snapshot persistence (persistSiriSnapshots)
- ✅ Episode merge logic (preserves dateAdded, handles subscription changes)

**Verify TestSupport has equivalent features**:
```bash
diff -u zpod/Controllers/PodcastManager.swift \
        Packages/TestSupport/Sources/TestSupport/InMemoryPodcastManager.swift
```

If TestSupport is missing features, port them BEFORE deleting zpod version.

### 3. Update Test Targets

Ensure all test targets import from TestSupport:

**AppSmokeTests**:
```swift
import TestSupport  // Should already be here
```

**zpodUITests**:
```swift
// If using in-memory manager for test fixtures
import TestSupport
let testManager = InMemoryPodcastManager(initial: testPodcasts)
```

**IntegrationTests**:
```swift
import TestSupport
```

**Package Tests**:
```swift
// DiscoverFeatureTests, NetworkingTests, etc.
import TestSupport
```

### 4. Delete Production File

```bash
git rm zpod/Controllers/PodcastManager.swift
```

### 5. Update Xcode Project

- Remove file reference from Xcode project navigator
- Verify no broken references in zpod target
- Clean build folder: `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`

### 6. Search for Documentation References

```bash
# Find any docs referencing the old location
grep -r "Controllers/PodcastManager" docs/ dev-log/ Issues/ README.md
```

Update any references to point to TestSupport version.

## Files to Delete

- ❌ `zpod/Controllers/PodcastManager.swift`

## Files to Keep

- ✅ `Packages/TestSupport/Sources/TestSupport/InMemoryPodcastManager.swift`
- ✅ `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/PodcastManaging.swift` (protocol)

## Dependencies

- **Blocked By**: Issue 27.2 (production app must be migrated first)
- **Related**: Issue 27.1 (PodcastRepository implementation)

## Testing Strategy

### Verification Steps

1. **Clean Build**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -c -b zpod
   # Should succeed with no errors
   ```

2. **Search for Orphaned References**:
   ```bash
   # No results expected:
   grep -r "Controllers/PodcastManager" . --include="*.swift"
   ```

3. **Regression Tests**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh
   # All tests should pass
   ```

4. **Test Targets Build**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -t AppSmokeTests
   ./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -t zpodUITests
   ./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -t IntegrationTests
   ```

## Known Risks

- **Test Breakage**: If tests were importing from production location
  - **Mitigation**: Verify all test imports use TestSupport before deleting
- **Documentation Staleness**: Old references in docs/dev-logs
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive grep search and update

## Definition of Done

- [ ] `zpod/Controllers/PodcastManager.swift` deleted
- [ ] No production code references the deleted file
- [ ] All test targets use TestSupport implementation
- [ ] All regression tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] Clean build with no warnings
- [ ] Git commit with clear message
- [ ] Merged to main branch

## Time Estimate

- Verify migration complete: 0.5 hours
- Compare implementations: 0.5 hours
- Delete file and update project: 0.5 hours
- Update documentation: 0.5 hours
- Testing and verification: 1 hour
- **Total**: ~3 hours
