# Issue 26.1: Restore zpod Run Configuration in Xcode

## Priority
High

## Status
üìù In Planning

## Description
Restore the Xcode scheme and target membership so the zpod application launches from Xcode again. Current configuration allows building and testing, but the Run action no longer produces an executable because the app target is missing its Swift sources and resources. The shared `zpod` scheme should expose the app for running (instead of the Swift package auto-scheme) so developers can use Cmd+R to launch the simulator when validating features tied to spec scenarios that require "Given the user has successfully launched the Podcast Addict app" (see `zpod/spec/spec.md`).

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Launching the app from Xcode succeeds
- **Given** the `zpod` scheme is selected in Xcode with an iPhone 16-class simulator
- **When** I press Run (‚åòR)
- **Then** the zpod app should build and install on the simulator without configuration errors
- **And** the app launches, showing the initial ContentView bridge placeholder
- **And** UI and integration tests continue to succeed using the same scheme

## Dependencies
- None (configuration-only change)

## Testing Strategy
- Rebuild the `zpod` scheme in Xcode and confirm the Run action targets the application executable
- Execute `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -b zpod` to verify the build succeeds with the updated target membership
- Run `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -t zpod,zpodUITests` or the default script invocation to confirm automated tests still pass

## Spec References
- `zpod/spec/spec.md` ‚Äì Global background statement "Given the user has successfully launched the Podcast Addict app"
