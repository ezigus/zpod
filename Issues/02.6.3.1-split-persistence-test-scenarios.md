# 02.6.3.1 - Split Multi-Relaunch Scenarios in SwipePersistence Tests

## Description

Currently, `SwipePersistenceTests` has a single consolidated test that validates multiple persistence scenarios (actions, haptics, full-swipe toggles) in one multi-relaunch workflow. Split this into focused tests where each scenario has its own test case.

## Problem Statement

1. **Single consolidated test** (`testSeededConfigurationPersistsAcrossControls`) verifies all persistence scenarios at once
2. **Difficult to debug**: When persistence fails, unclear which aspect (actions/haptics/toggles) failed
3. **Slow feedback**: Must wait for entire multi-scenario test even if only one aspect needs verification
4. **Reduced parallelization**: Can't run different persistence scenarios in parallel

## Proposed Solution

Split `SwipePersistenceTests` into 3-4 focused tests:
- `testActionsPersistAcrossRelaunch` - Verify leading/trailing actions persist
- `testHapticSettingsPersistAcrossRelaunch` - Verify haptic enabled/style persist
- `testFullSwipeTogglesPersistAcrossRelaunch` - Verify full-swipe toggles persist
- (Optional) `testCompleteConfigurationPersistsAcrossRelaunch` - End-to-end verification

Each test:
- Seeds only relevant configuration data
- Performs single relaunch
- Verifies only targeted persistence scenario
- Runs independently in ≤ 2 minutes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `SwipePersistenceTests` has 3-4 focused tests (one per persistence scenario)
- [ ] Each test seeds only relevant configuration (actions OR haptics OR toggles)
- [ ] Each test performs exactly one relaunch
- [ ] Each test completes in ≤ 2 minutes
- [ ] All original persistence coverage maintained
- [ ] Tests can run independently and in parallel
- [ ] `TestSummary.md` updated with new test mapping

## Benefits

- **Faster debugging**: Immediately know which persistence aspect failed
- **Better parallelization**: Can run persistence scenarios concurrently in CI
- **Clearer intent**: Each test name describes exactly what persistence is verified
- **Reduced runtime**: When fixing one aspect, only run that specific test
