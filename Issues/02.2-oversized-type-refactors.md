# Issue 02.2: Oversized Type Refactors

## Description
SwiftLint now enforces the 500-line type body constraint, but we temporarily suppressed it for several legacy components (CoreWorkflowIntegrationTests, EpisodeListViewModel, DefaultEpisodeFilterService). These areas combine multiple responsibilities (UI orchestration, domain logic, end-to-end workflows) and hinder maintainability. This issue tracks the structured decomposition work needed to retire the suppressions and keep the lint suite clean.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Draft and agree on decomposition plans for each oversized type (tests, view model, actor).
- Sub-issues completed to shrink each type below the SwiftLint `type_body_length` rule threshold without reintroducing lint suppressions.
- Regression lint run (`./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -l`) shows no `type_body_length` violations or suppressions for the targeted files.
- Updated documentation/dev logs explain the new module/test splits and any migration steps for contributors.

## Spec References
- zpod/spec/spec.md (Episode list sorting/filtering scenarios at lines 114, 170, 227).
- zpod/spec/discovery.md (Cross-library discovery workflows at lines 36-65).
- zpod/spec/ui.md (Episode List Sorting and Filtering section at lines 139-147).

## Dependencies
- Dependent on the sub-issues below to deliver refactors incrementally while keeping CI green.

## Testing Strategy
- Maintain TDD workflow while extracting logic into smaller units.
- Run targeted SwiftLint and affected test suites after each refactor (`./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -t <suite>` and `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -l`).
- Capture lint/test artifacts in `TestResults/` per standard process.
