# Issue 12.8.6: Increase Parallelism for Non-UI Suites

## Priority
Low

## Status
Open

## Description
Unit and integration jobs currently run serially with a single worker. Enabling `-maximum-parallel-testing-workers` for non-UI bundles could shrink overall pipeline time without affecting UI determinism. Preflight already builds artifacts, so added parallelism should mostly affect test execution.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Experiment with a parallel worker count (e.g., 2–4) for unit and integration jobs.
- [ ] Confirm no data races or shared-state issues in AppSmokeTests/IntegrationTests under parallel execution.
- [ ] Measure wall-clock reduction for unit/integration jobs across at least two runs.
- [ ] Keep UI jobs single-worker; document the worker settings per job type.

## Rationale / Links
- CI run 21566904369 shows unit jobs succeeded quickly; modest parallelism could further reduce matrix time without risk to UI suites.

## Testing Strategy
- Branch run with adjusted `xcodebuild` flags; compare job duration vs baseline.
- If issues appear, scope parallelism to subsets (e.g., only unit tests).
