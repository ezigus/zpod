## Priority
Low

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement comprehensive data export and backup system with multiple formats, cloud integration, and migration tools for complete data portability and backup solutions.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Multi-Format Data Export and Comprehensive Backup
- **Given** I want to export my podcast data for backup, analysis, or migration purposes
- **When** I access comprehensive data export and backup features
- **Then** I should be able to export data in multiple formats (OPML, JSON, CSV, XML) with comprehensive content inclusion
- **And** Export should include all app data: subscriptions, settings, playlists, listening history, bookmarks, notes, and preferences
- **And** I should be able to schedule automatic backups with configurable frequency and retention policies
- **And** Cloud integration should support major cloud storage providers with secure, encrypted backup storage

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Export Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. **Multi-Format Export System**
   - Create comprehensive data export engine supporting multiple formats
   - Implement OPML export for podcast subscriptions with rich metadata
   - Add JSON/XML export for complete app data with hierarchical structure
   - Create CSV export for analytics and external data analysis

2. **Comprehensive Data Inclusion**
   - Include all app data in export: subscriptions, settings, playlists, history
   - Add metadata preservation and data integrity validation
   - Create selective export options for specific data categories
   - Implement data anonymization options for privacy-conscious exports

### Phase 2: Cloud Integration and Automation (Week 2)
1. **Cloud Storage Integration**
   - Add support for major cloud providers (iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)
   - Implement secure, encrypted backup storage with user key management
   - Create cloud backup synchronization and versioning
   - Add backup restoration with conflict resolution and data merging

2. **Backup Automation and Management**
   - Create automated backup scheduling with configurable frequency
   - Implement backup retention policies and storage management
   - Add backup integrity verification and corruption detection
   - Create backup analytics and storage usage optimization

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Data serialization and export frameworks
- **Required**: Cloud storage SDKs and encryption libraries

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Time Estimate**: 2 weeks  
**Story Points**: 12
