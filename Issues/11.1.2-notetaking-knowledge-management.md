## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Rich Note-Taking and Cross-Episode Knowledge Management
- **Given** I want to take comprehensive notes and build knowledge across episodes
- **When** I create detailed notes and manage knowledge connections
- **Then** I should be able to create rich text notes with formatting, links, and multimedia integration
- **And** Notes should support cross-episode linking and reference creation for knowledge building
- **And** I should be able to organize notes with tags, categories, and hierarchical structure
- **And** Note templates should be available for different types of content (interviews, educational, news)
- **And** Knowledge graph visualization should show connections between notes, episodes, and topics
