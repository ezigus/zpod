# Issue 02.2.4: Workflow Test Support Consolidation

## Description
Breaking apart the monolithic workflow tests will require stronger reusable fixtures and builders. Today, setup logic for podcast/folder/search state lives inline inside `CoreWorkflowIntegrationTests`. This sub-issue covers extracting those helpers into `TestSupport` so future scenario-specific tests stay concise and maintainable.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Create dedicated factories/builders in `TestSupport` (or a new helper module) for podcast libraries, smart lists, playlists, and search indexes used across workflow tests.
- Update existing tests to consume the new helpers, eliminating duplicated setup blocks.
- Ensure helper APIs remain `Sendable`/actor-safe for async XCTest patterns.
- Document the helpers (README or inline doc comments) to guide contributors writing new tests.

## Spec References
- zpod/spec/discovery.md (Library discovery setup requirements at lines 36-120).
- zpod/spec/ui.md (Episode list interactions at lines 139-147).
- zpod/spec/playback.md (Queue and playlist behaviors at lines 96-140).

## Dependencies
- Supports Issue 02.2.1 by providing the shared infrastructure needed after decomposition.

## Testing Strategy
- Extend `TestSupportTests` or add new unit tests covering factory behavior.
- Run `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -t TestSupport` (falls back to `swift test`) along with targeted integration suites to confirm reliability.
