- **And** I should be able to nest folders up to 3 levels deep
- **And** Folders should show episode counts and unplayed indicators

#### Scenario 2: Tagging System
- **Given** I want to organize content with tags
- **When** I create and apply tags
- **Then** I should be able to create custom tags with names and colors
- **And** I should be able to apply multiple tags to podcasts and episodes
- **And** Tags should be searchable and filterable across all content
- **And** I should see tag suggestions based on content and usage patterns

#### Scenario 3: Advanced Filtering and Views

- **When** I use filtering options
- **Then** I should be able to filter by folders, tags, play status, and date ranges
- **And** I should be able to create custom views with saved filter combinations
- **And** I should be able to sort content by various criteria within each view
- **And** Filters should work across the entire library with real-time updates

#### Scenario 4: Smart Organization Features

1. **Tag Management**
   - Create tag creation and editing interface
   - Implement tag color coding and visual design
   - Add tag application to podcasts and episodes

2. **Tag Discovery**
   - Implement tag search and autocomplete
   - Create tag suggestion system
   - Add tag usage analytics and popular tags

### Phase 3: Advanced Filtering (Week 3-4)
1. **Filter Interface**
   - Create comprehensive filter selection interface
   - Implement multiple filter criteria combination
   - Add filter saving and custom view creation

2. **Sorting and Views**
   - Implement various sorting options within filters
   - Create saved view management
   - Add quick filter toggles and shortcuts

### Phase 4: Smart Features (Week 4)
1. **Automatic Organization**
   - Implement content-based folder and tag suggestions
   - Create automatic tagging rules engine
   - Add organization pattern detection

2. **Bulk Operations**
   - Create bulk tagging and folder assignment tools
   - Implement library reorganization utilities
   - Add organization import/export functionality

- `customization.md`: Content organization and folder management
- `discovery.md`: Content filtering and organization for discovery
- `ui.md`: Organization interface design patterns
- `content.md`: Content metadata and categorization

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Issue #07 (Folder/Tag Organization backend)
- **Required**: Issue #01 (Subscription management for podcast organization)
- **Recommended**: Issue #08 (Advanced search for content discovery)
- **Optional**: Issue #12 (Recommendations for smart organization suggestions)

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Time Estimate**: 3-4 weeks  
**Story Points**: 13

## Success Metrics
1. **Organization Efficiency**
   - Users can organize 50+ podcasts into folders within 10 minutes
   - Tag application and filtering complete within 2 seconds
   - Drag and drop operations are smooth and responsive

2. **Discovery Improvement**
   - Content filtering reduces browse time by 50% for large libraries
   - Smart suggestions achieve 70%+ user acceptance rate
   - Saved views are used regularly by users with organized libraries

3. **Usability Metrics**
   - Organization features are discoverable within 2 interactions
   - Bulk operations handle 100+ items efficiently
   - Folder navigation is intuitive and doesn't exceed 3 levels deep

## Risk Mitigation
- **Complexity**: Use progressive disclosure and clear visual hierarchy
- **Performance**: Implement efficient data structures for large organizational structures
- **User Adoption**: Provide guided onboarding for organization features
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure organization metadata persists reliably

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Organization logic, filtering algorithms, and tag management
2. **Integration Tests**: Backend organization service integration
3. **UI Tests**: Complete organization workflows and drag-and-drop operations
4. **Performance Tests**: Large library organization and filtering performance
5. **Usability Tests**: Organization feature discovery and adoption workflows
6. **Data Tests**: Organization persistence and synchronization reliability
