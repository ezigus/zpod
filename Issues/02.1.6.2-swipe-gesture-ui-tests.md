# Issue 02.1.6.2: Swipe Gesture Configuration UI Tests

## Description
Automate end-to-end coverage for the swipe gesture configuration workflow delivered in Issue 02.1.6. This work ensures the "Configure Swipe Actions" screen, presets, haptic toggles, and the resulting episode list gestures remain stable and accessible.

## Objectives
- Validate that users can add/remove swipe actions per edge, respect the three-action cap, and toggle full-swipe options.
- Verify presets, haptic enablement, and intensity selections persist across launches.
- Exercise configured swipe gestures inside the episode list to confirm selected actions execute and haptics fire when enabled.
- Capture accessibility checks (identifiers, VoiceOver strings) for configuration controls and rendered swipe buttons.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. UI automation script covers:
   - Opening `EpisodeListView`, invoking "Configure Swipe Actions", and modifying leading/trailing actions.
   - Applying each preset and asserting resulting UI state.
   - Toggling haptic feedback and intensity, then confirming persistence after app relaunch.
   - Toggling full-swipe allowances and verifying SwiftUI swipe behavior.
2. Test suite runs as part of `zpodUITests` plan with stable, event-driven waiters—no fixed sleeps.
3. Accessibility identifiers and labels required for automation exist (additions documented if new ones are needed).
4. Resulting test artifacts recorded in `TestResults/` and summarized in `dev-log/02.1.6-swipe-gestures-quick-actions.md`.

## Dependencies
- Scenario 6 implementation (Issue 02.1.6) merged to `main`.
- Settings persistence architecture extension (Issue 02.1.6.1) for `UISettings` storage.

## Spec References
- `Issues/02.1-episode-list-management-ui.md` — Scenario 6: Swipe gestures & quick actions.
- `zpod/spec/ui.md` — "Customizing Swipe Gestures" section.

## Testing Strategy
- Extend `zpodUITests` with targeted flows for the configuration sheet and swipe execution.
- Leverage existing wait/helper utilities to remain Swift 6 concurrency compliant.
- Capture regression in `dev-log` with timestamps, include screenshots if UI differs between presets.

## Notes
- Existing dev log already lists this follow-up—keep entries in sync as work progresses.
- Coordinate with future playlist/share enhancements to avoid duplicative UI assertions.
