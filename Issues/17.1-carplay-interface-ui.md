- **Then** I should see a simplified, driving-safe interface with large, easy-to-tap controls
- **And** The interface should follow CarPlay design guidelines and safety restrictions
- **And** Current episode should display immediately with essential information
- **And** All interactions should be optimized for quick, distraction-free use

#### Scenario 2: Driving-Safe Playback Controls
- **Given** I am using the app while driving
- **When** I control playback through CarPlay
- **Then** I should have access to play, pause, skip forward, and skip backward controls
- **And** Controls should be large enough for easy selection while driving
- **And** I should be able to adjust playback speed with simple up/down controls
- **And** Volume control should integrate with vehicle audio systems

#### Scenario 3: Content Browsing and Selection
- **Given** I want to choose different content while driving
- **When** I browse episodes and podcasts in CarPlay
- **Then** I should see recently played episodes and favorite podcasts prominently
- **And** Episode lists should show essential information only (title, podcast, duration)
- **And** I should be able to access downloaded episodes for offline listening
- **And** Navigation should be limited to essential features to minimize distraction

#### Scenario 4: Voice Control and Siri Integration
- **Given** I want hands-free control while driving
- **When** I use voice commands in CarPlay
- **Then** I should be able to play specific podcasts or episodes by voice
- **And** I should be able to control playback (play, pause, skip) using Siri
- **And** I should be able to ask for episode information or remaining time
- **And** Voice commands should work reliably with road noise and vehicle audio
