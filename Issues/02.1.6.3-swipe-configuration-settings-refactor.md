# Issue 02.1.6.3: Modular Swipe Configuration Settings

## Description
Refactor the swipe gesture configuration persistence stack to decouple it from the monolithic `SettingsManager` / `UISettings` pipeline. Introduce modular configuration services and repositories so swipe actions—and future UI configurations—can persist, reload, and observe their state without racing global settings initialization.

## Objectives
- Design a dedicated configuration service abstraction (actor-safe) with pluggable storage backends (UserDefaults-backed, in-memory test double).
- Move swipe gesture settings to that service while keeping compatibility shims for existing consumers.
- Provide async observation/notification hooks so UI surfaces can subscribe to configuration changes rather than polling `SettingsManager`.
- Ensure persistence writes complete synchronously (or expose completion) so relaunches see the saved preset immediately.
- Document the migration path for other UI configuration features.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `SwipeActionConfigurationViewModel` and `EpisodeListViewModel` rely on the new swipe configuration service for load/save/observations, no longer reading `SettingsManager.globalUISettings` directly.
2. The new service persists presets across relaunches deterministically (integration test proves save → relaunch → load returns latest config).
3. Existing API surface (`SettingsManager.updateGlobalUISettings`) continues to function for legacy consumers during the transition, delegating to the new service without data loss.
4. Comprehensive documentation (dev-log update + service README) covering architecture, concurrency model, and extension guidance for future configuration types.
5. CI passes with updated unit/integration/UI tests targeting the new abstraction.

## Dependencies
- Completion of Issue 02.1.6.2 debugging so current swipe UI automation reflects the desired behaviour before refactor.
- Awareness of Issue 02.1.6.1 settings architecture changes (to avoid regressions).

## Spec References
- `Issues/02.1-episode-list-management-ui.md` – Scenario 6: Swipe gestures & quick actions.
- `zpod/spec/ui.md` – Customizing swipe gestures.
- `Issues/12.7-ui-test-reliability-ci-hardening.md` – Async wait expectations for UI tests.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for the new configuration service (load, save, observation, failure handling).
- Integration tests exercising the storage backend (UserDefaults) and verifying deterministic persistence through app relaunch simulation.
- UI automation update: ensure configuration screens wait on service hydration and observe live updates.
- Regression pass on SettingsDomain tests to confirm legacy pathways remain intact during migration.
