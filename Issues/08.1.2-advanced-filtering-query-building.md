# Issue 08.1.2: Advanced Filtering and Query Building

## Priority
Medium

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement sophisticated search filtering system with complex query building, saveable search presets, and advanced content analysis filters. This provides power users with precise search control and reusable search strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Advanced Search Filters and Query Building
- **Given** I need to construct complex search queries and narrow down results
- **When** I access advanced search options and filter combinations
- **Then** I should be able to filter by comprehensive criteria: date ranges, duration, podcast, play status, rating, language, and custom tags
- **And** I should be able to combine multiple filters using AND/OR/NOT logic with visual query building interface
- **And** Filter combinations should be saveable as search presets with custom names and quick access
- **And** I should be able to search within specific organizational contexts (folders, tags, playlists)
- **And** Advanced filters should include content analysis results like topics, sentiment, and complexity levels

#### Scenario 2: Search Context and Organizational Integration
- **Given** I have organized content with folders, tags, and playlists
- **When** I want to search within specific organizational contexts
- **Then** I should be able to scope searches to specific folders, tags, or playlists
- **And** Search should understand organizational hierarchies and include nested content
- **And** Context-aware search should show how results relate to organizational structure
- **And** I should be able to save organizational search contexts as presets
- **And** Advanced filters should integrate with all organizational metadata

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Advanced Filter System (Week 1)
1. **Complex Filter Interface**
   - Create comprehensive filter selection with multiple criteria types
   - Implement Boolean logic (AND/OR/NOT) with visual query builder
   - Add filter combination preview with result count estimation
   - Create filter validation and error handling

2. **Search Preset Management**
   - Implement saveable search presets with custom naming
   - Add quick access to frequently used filter combinations
   - Create preset sharing and template creation
   - Add preset organization and categorization

### Phase 2: Organizational Integration and Content Analysis (Week 2)
1. **Organizational Context Search**
   - Implement search scoping to folders, tags, and playlists
   - Add hierarchical search within nested organizational structures
   - Create context-aware result display with organizational relationships
   - Add organizational metadata integration in search results

2. **Advanced Content Analysis Filters**
   - Implement topic-based filtering using content analysis
   - Add sentiment and complexity level filters
   - Create language and content quality filters
   - Add trending and popularity-based filter options

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Issue #08 (Advanced Search Core backend functionality)
- **Required**: Issue #08.1.1 (Core search interface)
- **Required**: Issue #07 (Content Organization for organizational filters)
- **Recommended**: Content analysis and natural language processing capabilities

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Time Estimate**: 2 weeks  
**Story Points**: 12

## Success Metrics
- Complex filters with 5+ criteria execute within 2 seconds
- Search presets save and restore accurately 100% of the time
- Organizational context search includes relevant nested content
- Content analysis filters improve search precision by 30%
