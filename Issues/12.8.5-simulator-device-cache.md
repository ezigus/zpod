# Issue 12.8.5: Cache Simulator Devices Across Runs

## Priority
Low

## Status
Open

## Description
Device creation is retried for every UI job. Keeping a small cache of precreated simulators (by device type/runtime) in the workspace could avoid repeated `simctl create` calls when the same runner handles sequential jobs. Need guardrails to validate health and recreate on failure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Prototype cache check that reuses an existing bootable simulator when present and healthy.
- [ ] Fallback logic that recreates on boot failure to avoid flakes.
- [ ] Measure reduction in “Provision dedicated simulator” step time on repeated jobs within a run.
- [ ] Ensure cleanup removes cached devices after the workflow to avoid leaking resources.

## Rationale / Links
- Current workflow provisions a fresh simulator per job; CI run 21566904369 shows ~2–3m spent here per UI job.

## Testing Strategy
- Branch run with cache enabled; log reuse vs recreate counts and job durations.
- Manual health-check script to validate cached devices before reuse.
