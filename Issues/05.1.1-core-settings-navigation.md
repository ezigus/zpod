## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Settings Navigation and Organization

- **When** I navigate through the settings interface
- **Then** I should see well-organized settings categories (Playback, Downloads, Appearance, Notifications, Privacy, etc.)
- **And** Tapping a category should navigate to detailed settings with proper back navigation
- **And** Settings should be grouped logically with clear section headers and descriptions
- **And** Search functionality should help me find specific settings quickly across all categories

#### Scenario 2: Confirmation Dialogs and User Experience
- **Given** I want to control app prompts and confirmations
- **When** I access behavior and confirmation settings
- **Then** I should be able to enable/disable confirmation dialogs for sensitive actions
- **And** Configurable confirmations should include: delete episode, unsubscribe, clear data
- **And** I should be able to set default actions for common operations
- **And** App should remember my preferences and apply them consistently

#### Scenario 3: User Interface and Appearance Customization
- **Given** I am in "Display" or "Appearance" settings
- **When** I modify interface appearance preferences
- **Then** I should be able to choose between light, dark, and automatic (system) themes
- **And** I should be able to adjust accent colors from available palette
- **And** I should be able to configure app icon appearance if alternate icons are supported
- **And** I should be able to adjust font sizes and layout density
- **And** Changes should be reflected immediately throughout the app interface
