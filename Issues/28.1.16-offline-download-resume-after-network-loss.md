# Issue 28.1.16 - Offline: Download Resume After Network Loss

**Status:** OPEN
**Priority:** Medium
**Category:** Feature / Testing
**Created:** 2026-02-16
**Parent Issue:** 28.1

## Description

Implement and test download resume behavior when network is lost during an active download and subsequently restored.

## Spec Scenarios (from `spec/offline-playback.md`)

1. **Network loss during download** — download pauses, partial data preserved
2. **Network restored** — download resumes from where it left off (not from start)
3. **Multiple interruptions** — download survives repeated network drops

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Download pauses cleanly when network is lost mid-download
- [ ] Download resumes from partial data when network is restored
- [ ] URLSession resume data is preserved across network interruptions
- [ ] UI shows appropriate status during each state transition
- [ ] Integration test validates resume-from-partial behavior

## Notes

Current `testPauseAndResumeDownload` tests manual pause/resume, NOT network-loss recovery. This is a different scenario requiring network monitor integration with DownloadCoordinator.

## Dependencies

- Requires: Issue 28.1 (download infrastructure), NetworkMonitor
- Related: Issue 28.1.13 (current download tests)
