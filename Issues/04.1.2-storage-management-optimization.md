# Issue 04.1.2: Storage Management and Optimization

## Priority
High

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement comprehensive storage management interface with detailed analytics, intelligent cleanup tools, batch operations, and storage optimization recommendations. This provides users with complete control over their downloaded content storage and automated cleanup capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Intelligent Storage Management and Optimization
- **Given** I have downloaded content and limited device storage
- **When** I navigate to the storage management section
- **Then** I should see detailed storage breakdown by podcast, episode, and quality level
- **And** I should see total storage used, available space, and projected needs based on download settings
- **And** I should be able to delete downloaded episodes individually, by podcast, or using smart criteria
- **And** I should receive proactive storage warnings with suggested cleanup actions
- **And** I should be able to optimize storage by re-encoding episodes to different quality levels

#### Scenario 2: Download History and Analytics
- **Given** I want to understand my download patterns and data usage
- **When** I access download analytics and history
- **Then** I should see comprehensive download statistics including data usage by time period and podcast
- **And** I should see failed download reports with reasons and suggested actions
- **And** I should be able to track download efficiency and identify problematic feeds or episodes
- **And** I should be able to export download data for analysis or carrier billing verification
- **And** Analytics should help optimize my download settings for data usage and storage

#### Scenario 3: Batch Download Operations and Smart Selection
- **Given** I want to efficiently manage downloads for multiple episodes and podcasts
- **When** I perform batch download operations
- **Then** I should be able to select multiple episodes using various criteria (unplayed, recent, podcast-specific)
- **And** Batch downloads should show combined progress and allow group control (pause all, cancel all)
- **And** I should be able to set different quality levels for different types of content in batch operations
- **And** Smart selection should suggest logical episode groups for batch downloading
- **And** Batch operations should handle errors gracefully and continue with remaining items

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Storage Analytics and Visualization (Week 1)
1. **Comprehensive Storage Dashboard**
   - Create interactive storage breakdown charts by podcast, quality, and time period
   - Implement real-time storage calculations with efficient caching
   - Add storage trend analysis and future projection based on download patterns
   - Create visual storage optimization recommendations with impact estimates

2. **Storage Management Tools**
   - Implement individual and bulk episode deletion with confirmation dialogs
   - Add smart cleanup criteria (age, play status, storage pressure)
   - Create storage optimization engine with quality re-encoding options
   - Add proactive storage monitoring with automated warnings

### Phase 2: Analytics and Batch Operations (Week 2)
1. **Download Analytics and Reporting**
   - Create comprehensive download statistics dashboard
   - Implement data usage tracking by time period and podcast
   - Add failed download analysis with actionable recommendations
   - Create data export functionality for external analysis

2. **Advanced Batch Operations**
   - Implement sophisticated multi-selection with criteria-based filtering
   - Add batch download progress visualization and group controls
   - Create smart selection algorithms for logical episode grouping
   - Add robust error handling for batch operations

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Issue #04 (Download Core backend functionality)
- **Required**: Issue #04.1.1 (Core download progress interface)
- **Recommended**: Issue #24 (Data export for analytics)

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Time Estimate**: 2 weeks  
**Story Points**: 11

## Success Metrics
- Storage calculations complete within 2 seconds for 1000+ episodes
- Storage analytics provide actionable insights for 95% of users
- Batch operations handle 100+ items without performance degradation
- Storage optimization recommendations save average 20% storage space
