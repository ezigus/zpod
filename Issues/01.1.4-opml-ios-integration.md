# Issue 01.1.4: OPML Import/Export and iOS Ecosystem Integration

## Priority
Medium

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement comprehensive OPML import/export functionality and deep iOS ecosystem integration including iCloud sync, Siri shortcuts, and Apple ID integration for seamless subscription management across the Apple ecosystem.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: OPML Import and Export
- **Given** I have an OPML file with subscriptions or want to backup my subscriptions
- **When** I select "OPML import" and choose a file, or select "Export OPML" in settings
- **Then** For import: all valid feeds should be added to subscriptions with proper error handling
- **And** For export: app should generate and save an OPML file containing all subscriptions
- **And** Both operations should provide clear progress feedback and success/error messages
- **And** Imported subscriptions should maintain folder organization if present in OPML

#### Scenario 2: iOS Shortcuts and API Integration
- **Given** I have external automation apps (iOS Shortcuts, Siri)
- **When** I enable API integration in settings and create shortcuts
- **Then** External apps should be able to trigger actions (subscribe, play, update) via automation
- **And** Siri should be able to subscribe to podcasts by voice command
- **And** Shortcuts should support complex workflows like "subscribe to podcast and download latest episode"
- **And** API integration should respect app privacy and security settings

#### Scenario 3: Apple ID Sign-In and iCloud Sync
- **Given** I want to sync subscriptions and preferences across devices
- **When** I sign in with Apple ID and enable iCloud sync
- **Then** Subscriptions and discovery preferences should sync automatically across all devices
- **And** Folder organization and per-podcast settings should be preserved
- **And** Sync should handle conflicts intelligently (merge, newest wins, or user choice)
- **And** Offline subscription changes should sync when internet becomes available

#### Scenario 4: Accessibility for Discovery Features
- **Given** I have accessibility needs (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, high contrast)
- **When** I use discovery and subscription features
- **Then** All controls and features should be fully compatible with VoiceOver with descriptive labels
- **And** Interface should adapt to Dynamic Type settings without losing functionality
- **And** High contrast mode should be supported with appropriate color adjustments
- **And** Complex interfaces like search results should be properly structured for screen readers

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: OPML and Data Portability (Week 1)
1. **OPML Import/Export Engine**
   - Implement OPML file parsing with robust error handling
   - Create OPML generation with full subscription metadata
   - Add progress tracking and user feedback for import/export operations
   - Create validation and error reporting for malformed OPML files

2. **Data Migration and Backup**
   - Add subscription backup creation with metadata preservation
   - Implement restore functionality with conflict resolution
   - Create data validation and integrity checking
   - Add migration from other podcast apps via OPML

### Phase 2: iOS Ecosystem Integration (Week 2)
1. **Siri and Shortcuts Integration**
   - Implement INIntent definitions for subscription and playback actions
   - Add Siri voice command support with natural language processing
   - Create iOS Shortcuts support with complex workflow capabilities
   - Add privacy controls and user consent for external automation

2. **iCloud Sync and Cross-Device Support**
   - Implement CloudKit integration for subscription synchronization
   - Add conflict resolution with user choice and automatic merging
   - Create sync status indicators and manual sync triggers
   - Add offline change queue with automatic sync when online

3. **Comprehensive Accessibility**
   - Audit all subscription management features for VoiceOver compatibility
   - Implement Dynamic Type support with proper layout adaptation
   - Add high contrast and reduced motion support
   - Create accessible complex interactions with clear audio feedback

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Time Estimate**: 2 weeks  
**Story Points**: 11

## Success Metrics
- OPML import/export success rate exceeds 95%
- iCloud sync completes within 10 seconds for typical libraries
- Siri voice commands work accurately for subscription management
- iOS Shortcuts integration responds within 3 seconds
- Full accessibility compliance with VoiceOver and assistive technologies

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: OPML parsing accuracy and CloudKit sync logic
- **Integration Tests**: Siri, Shortcuts, and iCloud integration
- **UI Tests**: Complete accessibility compliance testing
- **Performance Tests**: Sync performance with large subscription libraries
