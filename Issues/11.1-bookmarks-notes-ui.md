# Issue 11.1: Bookmarks and Notes UI

## Priority
Medium

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement comprehensive bookmarks and episode notes interface including timestamp-based bookmarks, rich text notes, and cross-episode note search. This builds on the bookmarks and notes backend (Issue #14) to provide complete content annotation and reference capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Bookmark Creation and Management
- **Given** I am listening to an episode
- **When** I want to bookmark an interesting moment
- **Then** I should be able to create a bookmark with a single tap during playback
- **And** I should be able to add a title and description to the bookmark
- **And** Bookmarks should automatically capture the current timestamp and episode context
- **And** I should be able to organize bookmarks with custom tags and categories

#### Scenario 2: Episode Notes and Rich Text Editing
- **Given** I want to take detailed notes about an episode
- **When** I access the note-taking interface
- **Then** I should be able to create rich text notes with formatting options
- **And** I should be able to insert timestamp references that link back to specific moments
- **And** Notes should support bullet points, numbered lists, and basic text styling
- **And** I should be able to add images, links, and other media to my notes

#### Scenario 3: Bookmark and Note Navigation
- **Given** I have created bookmarks and notes
- **When** I want to review them
- **Then** I should see a dedicated bookmarks section with all my saved moments
- **And** I should be able to browse notes by episode, podcast, or chronologically
- **And** Tapping a bookmark should jump directly to that moment in the episode
- **And** I should be able to search across all bookmarks and notes with text matching

#### Scenario 4: Cross-Episode Note Organization
- **Given** I have notes and bookmarks across multiple episodes
- **When** I want to organize my annotations
- **Then** I should be able to create note collections that span multiple episodes
- **And** I should be able to tag and categorize notes for easy retrieval
- **And** I should be able to export notes and bookmarks for external use
- **And** The app should suggest related bookmarks and notes while listening
