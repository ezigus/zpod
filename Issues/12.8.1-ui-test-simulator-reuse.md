# Issue 12.8.1: Reuse Single Simulator Across UI Matrices

## Priority
Medium

## Status
Open

## Description
Investigate reusing a single booted simulator across the UI matrix jobs to eliminate repeated create/boot/pre-warm cycles. Current UI jobs spend ~3–4 minutes provisioning and warming a fresh device per job even though they all restore the same preflight-built host/test bundles. Sharing a UDID (with aggressive app state reset between suites) could cut several minutes per job.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Prototype workflow change that provisions one simulator in a setup step and passes its UDID to all UI jobs.
- [ ] Add cleanup/reset between suites to avoid state bleed (app uninstall/reset, storage wipe, and relaunch).
- [ ] Measure end-to-end wall-clock reduction vs current per-job provisioning (target: ≥2 minutes saved per UI job).
- [ ] Document rollback/guardrails if shared simulator proves flaky.

## Rationale / Links
- CI run 21566904369 shows ~3–4m per UI job spent on simulator creation/boot/pre-warm despite preflight reuse.
- Complements existing preflight build reuse.

## Testing Strategy
- A/B run on a feature branch comparing current matrix vs shared-UDID matrix; record durations and flake rate.
- Ensure cleanup step verified by running two UI suites back-to-back locally using the same simulator to confirm isolation.
