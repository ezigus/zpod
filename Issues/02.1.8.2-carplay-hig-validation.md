# Issue 02.1.8.2: CarPlay HIG & Voice Validation

## Description
Audit the CarPlay episode list and Siri integration against Apple's Human Interface Guidelines. Validate the end-to-end flow (CarPlay UI, Siri voice commands, playback/queue actions) in the CarPlay simulator and document touch-target and motion-safety compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- CarPlay episode and podcast templates demonstrate 44pt minimum touch targets and high-contrast text in screenshots or simulator captures.
- Motion-restricted states (vehicle in motion) avoid presenting multi-step dialogs or text entry per HIG.
- Siri voice commands ("Play <podcast>", "Play latest episode", "Add to queue") succeed in CarPlay simulator with confirmation prompts when needed.
- Manual test results appended to the Issue 02.1.8 dev-log section.
- Any visual or UX gaps identified are tracked with follow-up tasks.

## Dependencies
- Data wiring and Siri intent handling available (Issue 02.1.8.1).
- CarPlay simulator configured per `CARPLAY_SETUP.md`.

## Spec References
- `spec/ui.md` – Navigating with CarPlay Layout.
- CarPlay Human Interface Guidelines.

## Testing Strategy
- Manual CarPlay simulator test pass with checklist (tap targets, safety alerts, Siri commands).
- Capture screenshots/logs demonstrating compliance.
- Optional UI automation harness for CarPlay templates (if feasible).
