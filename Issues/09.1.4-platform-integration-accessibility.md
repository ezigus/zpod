## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: CarPlay Discovery Integration
- **Given** I am connected to CarPlay and want to discover new content while driving
- **When** I access discovery features through CarPlay interface
- **Then** I should see automotive-safe discovery interface with voice-driven navigation
- **And** Discovery should be optimized for automotive use with large touch targets and simplified categories
- **And** I should be able to access trending content and recommendations safely while driving
- **And** Voice commands should allow browsing categories and accessing recommended content

#### Scenario 2: Apple Watch Discovery Integration
- **Given** I have an Apple Watch and want to discover content for wearable listening
- **When** I use discovery features on Apple Watch
- **Then** I should see curated discovery content optimized for watch interface
- **And** Discovery should focus on essential recommendations and trending content
- **And** Digital Crown should enable efficient navigation through discovery categories
- **And** Watch complications should provide quick access to discovery highlights

#### Scenario 3: Comprehensive Discovery Accessibility Features
- **Given** I am using accessibility features (VoiceOver, Voice Control, Switch Control)
- **When** I explore discovery features and browse content
- **Then** All discovery controls should have descriptive labels including content type and popularity indicators
- **And** VoiceOver should announce discovery categories, recommendations, and content details clearly
- **And** Dynamic Type should scale all discovery interface elements appropriately
- **And** Voice Control should allow complete discovery navigation using voice commands
- **And** Alternative interaction methods should be supported for users with motor accessibility needs
