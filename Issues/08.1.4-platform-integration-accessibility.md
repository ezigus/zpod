## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: CarPlay Search Integration
- **Given** I am connected to CarPlay and want to search for content while driving
- **When** I access search features through CarPlay interface
- **Then** I should be able to perform voice-driven searches using Siri with automotive-optimized results
- **And** Search results should be simplified and optimized for automotive use with large touch targets
- **And** I should be able to access recent searches and search shortcuts quickly and safely
- **And** Search should prioritize safety with minimal driver distraction and hands-free operation

#### Scenario 2: Apple Watch Search Integration
- **Given** I have an Apple Watch and want to search for content for wearable listening
- **When** I use search features on Apple Watch
- **Then** I should be able to perform voice searches using Siri on the watch
- **And** Search results should be optimized for watch display with essential information only
- **And** I should be able to access recent searches and shortcuts through watch interface
- **And** Digital Crown should enable efficient navigation through search results

#### Scenario 3: Comprehensive Search Accessibility Features
- **Given** I am using accessibility features (VoiceOver, Voice Control, Switch Control)
- **When** I perform searches and interact with search results
- **Then** All search controls should have descriptive labels including search progress and result counts
- **And** VoiceOver should announce search results, filters, and result navigation clearly
- **And** Dynamic Type should scale all search interface elements appropriately
- **And** Voice Control should allow complete search functionality using voice commands
- **And** Alternative interaction methods should be supported for users with motor accessibility needs
