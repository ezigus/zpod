## Priority
Medium

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement local audio file management interface allowing users to import, organize, and manage their personal audio files as "virtual podcasts" within the app. This extends the app's functionality to handle user-owned content alongside subscribed podcasts.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Local Audio File Import
- **Given** I have personal audio files I want to manage
- **When** I access the "Local Content" or "Virtual Podcasts" section
- **Then** I should be able to import audio files from my device, iCloud, or file sharing services
- **And** I should be able to select multiple files for batch import
- **And** The app should support common audio formats (MP3, M4A, WAV, FLAC)
- **And** Import progress should be clearly displayed with the ability to cancel

#### Scenario 2: Virtual Podcast Creation and Organization
- **Given** I have imported local audio files
- **When** I organize my local content
- **Then** I should be able to create virtual podcasts as containers for related files
- **And** I should be able to assign custom names, descriptions, and artwork to virtual podcasts
- **And** I should be able to organize files into logical groups (albums, series, collections)
- **And** Each virtual podcast should appear alongside regular subscriptions in my library

#### Scenario 3: Local Content Playback and Management
- **Given** I have organized virtual podcasts with local files
- **When** I interact with local content
- **Then** I should be able to play local files with the same controls as regular episodes
- **And** Playback progress should be tracked and persistent across sessions
- **And** I should be able to edit file metadata (title, artist, description, artwork)
- **And** I should be able to reorder files within virtual podcasts

#### Scenario 4: Local Content Integration
- **Given** I use both subscribed podcasts and local content
- **When** I navigate the app
- **Then** Local content should integrate seamlessly with regular podcast features
- **And** I should be able to add local files to playlists alongside regular episodes
- **And** Search should include local content in results
- **And** Statistics and history should track local content listening equally
