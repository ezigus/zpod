# Issue 24.1: Comprehensive Data Export and Backup UI

## Priority
Medium

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement comprehensive data export, backup, and restore interfaces allowing users to export listening statistics, backup all app data, and manage data portability. This ensures users have full control over their data and can migrate between devices or services.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Data Export and Statistics Export
- **Given** I want to analyze or backup my listening data
- **When** I access data export features
- **Then** I should be able to export listening statistics in standard formats (CSV, JSON)
- **And** I should be able to export subscription lists in OPML format
- **And** I should be able to export playlist data and organization
- **And** I should be able to choose date ranges and specific data types for export

#### Scenario 2: Comprehensive App Backup
- **Given** I want to backup all my app data
- **When** I create a full backup
- **Then** I should be able to backup all settings, subscriptions, and preferences
- **And** I should be able to backup playlists, bookmarks, and personal notes
- **And** I should be able to choose backup destinations (local, iCloud, file sharing)
- **And** Backup should include virtual podcasts and local content organization

#### Scenario 3: Data Restore and Migration
- **Given** I have backed up data or want to migrate to a new device
- **When** I restore data from backup
- **Then** I should be able to browse and select backup files from various sources
- **And** I should be able to preview backup contents before restoration
- **And** I should be able to selectively restore specific data types or settings
- **And** Restore process should handle conflicts and provide merge options

#### Scenario 4: Cloud Service Integration
- **Given** I want to use cloud services for backup and sync
- **When** I set up cloud integration
- **Then** I should be able to connect to multiple cloud services (iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox)
- **And** I should be able to schedule automatic backups
- **And** I should be able to sync data across multiple devices
- **And** Cloud sync should handle conflicts and provide resolution options

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Time Estimate**: 3-4 weeks  
**Story Points**: 13

## Success Metrics
1. **Data Protection and Portability**
   - Users successfully backup and restore their complete app data
   - Export features provide useful data in standard formats
   - Migration between devices works reliably and completely

2. **Cloud Integration Effectiveness**
   - Cloud backup and sync work reliably across services
   - Automatic backups prevent data loss scenarios
   - Cross-device sync maintains data consistency

3. **User Adoption and Trust**
   - Users discover and use backup features proactively
   - Export features meet user needs for data analysis and portability
   - Backup and restore provide confidence in data safety

## Risk Mitigation
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure proper encryption and security for backup data
- **Cloud Reliability**: Handle cloud service outages and connectivity issues gracefully
- **Data Integrity**: Implement thorough validation and verification of backup/restore processes
- **User Experience**: Make backup and restore processes clear and non-intimidating

## Testing Strategy
1. **Data Integrity Tests**: Verify complete and accurate backup and restore of all data types
2. **Cloud Integration Tests**: Test backup and sync across different cloud services
3. **Migration Tests**: Complete device-to-device migration scenarios
4. **Performance Tests**: Backup and restore performance with large data sets
5. **Security Tests**: Data encryption and privacy protection during backup and sync
6. **Recovery Tests**: Data recovery scenarios and corruption handling
