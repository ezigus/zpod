# Issue 02.1.6.5: Full Regression After Modular Settings

## Priority
High

## Status
ðŸ†• Proposed

## Description
Run a complete regression once the modular settings stack is stable and macOS test support (Issue 03.1.4) is in place. This ensures swipe configuration, new modular settings features, and the broader app experience remain green before shipping the 02.1.6 wave.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `IntegrationTests` target is wired into the Xcode test plan/scheme via Issue 03.1.4.
- macOS SwiftPM support is enabled (SettingsDomain/Persistence `swift test` succeeds) per Issue 03.1.4.
- Execute these commands on macOS with Xcode:
  1. `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh --self-check`
  2. `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -t SwipeConfigurationUITests`
  3. `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -t IntegrationTests`
  4. `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -c -s -b zpod -t zpod`
- Capture result bundles/logs in `TestResults/` for each run (retain the latest three per suite).
- No unexpected crashes or new failures; any intermittent UI flakes are triaged with follow-up issues if they persist.
- Dev log is updated with regression timestamps and outcomes.

## Dependencies
- Blocked by Issue 03.1.4 (macOS support + scheme wiring).
- Relies on completion of 02.1.6.3 modular settings refactor.

## Testing Strategy
- Execute the command list above sequentially once Issue 03.1.4 lands.
- If any failures occur, record logs/xcresults and file follow-up issues before re-running.
- Verify GitHub Actions mirrors the final command set (zpod, zpodUITests, IntegrationTests) with parallel execution.
