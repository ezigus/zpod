## Priority
High

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement the core discovery and search interface for finding and browsing podcasts. This focuses on the fundamental search functionality, result display, and basic subscription actions that form the foundation of podcast discovery.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Basic Podcast Search and Discovery
- **Given** I am on the Discover tab with an active internet connection
- **When** I search for "Swift Talk" podcast using keywords, category, or episode title
- **Then** I should see relevant podcast results with artwork, titles, descriptions, and ratings
- **And** I should be able to tap "Subscribe" to add the podcast to my library
- **And** The subscription should appear immediately in my Library tab with proper metadata
- **And** Episodes should become available for browsing and download

#### Scenario 2: Advanced Search Across All Content
- **Given** I want to search across all podcasts, episodes, and show notes
- **When** I use the unified search interface with text query
- **Then** Results should include podcasts, individual episodes, and show note content
- **And** I should be able to filter results by content type, duration, date, and rating
- **And** Search should work across both subscribed and discoverable content
- **And** I should be able to subscribe to podcasts directly from search results

#### Scenario 3: Search Performance and Real-time Results
- **Given** I am typing in the search field
- **When** I enter search terms with real-time feedback
- **Then** Search results should appear within 2 seconds with debounced queries
- **And** Results should update in real-time as I type with smooth animations
- **And** Recent searches should be saved and easily accessible
- **And** Search should work offline for previously cached content

#### Scenario 4: Adding Podcast by Direct RSS Feed URL
- **Given** I know the RSS feed URL of a podcast
- **When** I select "Add by RSS Feed URL" and enter the URL
- **Then** The app should validate the feed and add the podcast with proper error handling
- **And** Custom RSS feeds should support user-configurable parsing options and filters
- **And** Private or password-protected feeds should be supported with authentication
- **And** Invalid or corrupted feeds should show clear error messages with retry options
