# Issue 12.9.3 - Deprecation Warning Migrations

## Description
Migrate deprecated APIs referenced in current builds, including AVAudioSession options and SwiftUI `onChange` signatures.

## Acceptance Criteria
- No deprecation warnings for:
  - `allowBluetooth` (replace with `allowBluetoothHFP`).
  - `onChange(of:perform:)` (migrate to the iOS 17+ variants).
- Behavior remains consistent with existing UI and audio session expectations.

## Spec References
- N/A (build hygiene / compiler warnings)

## Dependencies
- None.

## Testing Strategy
- Run `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -b zpod` and confirm deprecation warnings are gone.
- Spot-check affected UI behavior where `onChange` is used.
