# Issue 12.9.5 - AppIntents Metadata Warning Review

## Description
Investigate repeated `appintentsmetadataprocessor` warnings stating metadata extraction is skipped due to missing `AppIntents.framework`. Determine whether to add AppIntents dependency for relevant targets or suppress/disable metadata extraction where not needed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Decision documented: either add AppIntents dependencies where metadata is required, or configure build settings to suppress the metadata extraction for targets that do not use AppIntents.
- Build logs no longer show the repeated metadata extraction warnings.

## Spec References
- N/A (build tooling hygiene)

## Dependencies
- None.

## Testing Strategy
- Run `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -b zpod` and confirm the warning no longer appears.
