# Issue 04.1.1: Core Download Progress and Queue Management

## Priority
High

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement fundamental download progress tracking and queue management interface with real-time progress indicators, queue reordering, error handling, and download state management. This provides the core download user experience with visual feedback and basic control operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Advanced Download Progress and Queue Management
- **Given** I am downloading episodes from multiple podcasts
- **When** I view the downloads section
- **Then** I should see all downloads with real-time progress indicators, speed, and estimated completion time
- **And** I should see an organized download queue with pending, active, paused, and completed states
- **And** I should be able to pause, resume, or cancel individual downloads with instant feedback
- **And** I should be able to reorder pending downloads using drag and drop or priority settings
- **And** Downloads should automatically retry failed attempts with exponential backoff

#### Scenario 2: Download Queue Prioritization and Bandwidth Management
- **Given** I have multiple episodes queued for download with limited bandwidth
- **When** I manage download priorities and network usage
- **Then** I should be able to set high/medium/low priority for different podcasts and episodes
- **And** I should be able to limit concurrent downloads and bandwidth usage per connection type
- **And** Critical downloads (manually requested) should automatically take priority over auto-downloads
- **And** I should be able to pause all downloads during important network activities
- **And** Downloads should adapt to network conditions and automatically resume when connectivity improves

#### Scenario 3: Advanced Download Error Handling and Recovery
- **Given** Downloads may fail due to network issues, server problems, or storage constraints
- **When** I encounter download problems
- **Then** Failed downloads should be clearly indicated with specific error information
- **And** I should be able to retry failed downloads with one tap or automatic retry with smart delays
- **And** Partial downloads should be preserved and resumed when possible
- **And** Network timeouts should be handled gracefully with appropriate retry strategies
- **And** I should be able to report persistent download issues with diagnostic information

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Download Interface (Week 1)
1. **Real-Time Progress Display**
   - Create download progress interface with speed, ETA, and visual indicators
   - Implement responsive progress updates without UI blocking
   - Add download state visualization (pending, active, paused, completed, failed)
   - Create detailed download information panel with file size and network status

2. **Basic Queue Management**
   - Implement download queue display with reorderable list interface
   - Add individual download controls (pause, resume, cancel)
   - Create drag-and-drop reordering functionality
   - Implement priority level assignment (high, medium, low)

### Phase 2: Advanced Queue Features and Error Handling (Week 2)
1. **Advanced Queue Operations**
   - Add batch queue operations (pause all, cancel group)
   - Implement bandwidth management and concurrent download limits
   - Create network condition adaptation and automatic resume
   - Add critical download prioritization logic

2. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
   - Implement detailed error reporting with diagnostic information
   - Add automatic retry with exponential backoff
   - Create partial download preservation and resume capability
   - Add error reporting and diagnostic tools

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Issue #04 (Download Core backend functionality)
- **Required**: Issue #01 (Subscription management for episode access)

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Time Estimate**: 2 weeks  
**Story Points**: 10

## Success Metrics
- Real-time progress updates without UI lag
- Download queue operations complete within 500ms
- Error recovery succeeds in >90% of network interruption cases
- Queue reordering works smoothly with 50+ items
