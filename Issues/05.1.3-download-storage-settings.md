# Issue 05.1.3: Download and Storage Settings

## Priority
High

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement comprehensive download and storage management settings with automatic cleanup policies, storage analytics, and network usage controls. This provides users with complete control over download behavior and storage optimization.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Global Download and Update Frequency Management
- **Given** I am in "Download" and "Update" settings sections
- **When** I configure global download and update preferences
- **Then** I should be able to set auto-download policies (latest episode, all new episodes, none)
- **And** I should be able to configure update frequency for podcast feeds (hourly, daily, weekly)
- **And** I should be able to set storage location and automatic cleanup policies
- **And** I should be able to restrict downloads and updates to Wi-Fi only
- **And** App should follow these rules consistently across all podcasts

#### Scenario 2: Global Cleanup Policies and Storage Management
- **Given** I am in "Automatic Cleanup" and storage settings
- **When** I configure cleanup rules and storage management
- **Then** I should be able to enable automatic cleanup with configurable rules
- **And** I should be able to set episode retention policies (keep X episodes, delete after X days)
- **And** I should be able to configure recycle bin functionality for accidental deletions
- **And** I should see storage usage statistics and cleanup recommendations
- **And** App should manage episode deletion according to configured policies

#### Scenario 3: Network Restrictions and Data Usage Controls
- **Given** I am in "Network" or "Data Usage" settings
- **When** I configure network usage preferences
- **Then** I should be able to enable "Wi-Fi only" restrictions for streaming and downloading
- **And** I should be able to set cellular data limits and warnings
- **And** I should be able to configure different policies for background vs foreground usage
- **And** App should respect these restrictions and prevent unexpected mobile data usage

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Download Configuration and Automation (Week 1)
1. **Auto-Download Policy Settings**
   - Create comprehensive auto-download policy configuration
   - Implement update frequency settings for podcast feeds
   - Add storage location selection and management
   - Create network restriction settings (Wi-Fi only, cellular limits)

2. **Download Quality and Optimization**
   - Implement download quality preferences with storage impact visualization
   - Add bandwidth management and concurrent download controls
   - Create smart download scheduling based on usage patterns
   - Add download queue priority management settings

### Phase 2: Storage Management and Cleanup (Week 2)
1. **Automatic Cleanup Policies**
   - Create configurable automatic cleanup rules engine
   - Implement episode retention policies with multiple criteria
   - Add recycle bin functionality for accidental deletion recovery
   - Create storage usage analytics and recommendations

2. **Network and Data Usage Controls**
   - Implement granular network usage restrictions
   - Add cellular data limit monitoring and warnings
   - Create background vs foreground usage policies
   - Add data usage analytics and reporting

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Issue #05 (Settings Core backend functionality)
- **Required**: Issue #05.1.1 (Core settings navigation)
- **Required**: Issue #04 (Download Core for integration)
- **Recommended**: Issue #04.1.2 (Storage management interface)

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Time Estimate**: 2 weeks  
**Story Points**: 12

## Success Metrics
- Auto-download policies execute consistently without missing episodes
- Storage cleanup rules reduce manual management by 80%
- Network restrictions prevent unexpected cellular data usage in 100% of cases
- Storage analytics provide actionable insights for optimization
