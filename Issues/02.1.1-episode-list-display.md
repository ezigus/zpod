# Issue 02.1.1: Episode List Display and Basic Navigation

## Priority
High

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement the core episode list display interface with smooth navigation, progressive loading, and responsive design that works across iPhone and iPad form factors.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Episode List Display and Navigation
- **Given** I have subscribed to podcasts with episodes
- **When** I tap on a podcast in my library
- **Then** I should see a well-organized list of episodes with artwork, titles, duration, and publication dates
- **And** I should be able to scroll smoothly through large episode lists with lazy loading
- **And** Tapping an episode should open the detailed episode view with enhanced metadata
- **And** Episode artwork should load progressively without blocking the interface
- **And** List should adapt properly for iPad with multi-column layout and Split View support

#### Scenario 2: Performance and Responsive Design
- **Given** I am browsing large episode lists on different devices
- **When** I scroll through hundreds of episodes
- **Then** Scrolling should remain smooth and responsive with minimal memory usage
- **And** Images should load efficiently with proper caching and placeholder states
- **And** Interface should adapt appropriately to iPhone, iPad, and different orientations
- **And** Pull-to-refresh should work smoothly with haptic feedback

#### Scenario 3: Episode Preview and Quick Actions
- **Given** I want to preview episode content without opening full details
- **When** I use quick preview gestures or hover states
- **Then** I should see episode preview with description snippet and quick action buttons
- **And** Quick actions should include play, download, share, and add to playlist
- **And** Preview should be dismissible without disrupting list navigation
- **And** Quick actions should provide immediate feedback and work reliably

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core List Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. **Episode List View Controller**
   - Create efficient table/collection view with reusable cells
   - Implement progressive image loading with SDWebImage or similar
   - Add pull-to-refresh functionality with haptic feedback
   - Create smooth scrolling with lazy loading optimization

2. **Responsive Design Implementation**
   - Add iPad-specific layout with multi-column support
   - Implement Split View compatibility and adaptive layouts
   - Create orientation change handling with smooth transitions
   - Add Dynamic Type support for accessibility

### Phase 2: Interactive Features (Week 2)
1. **Episode Preview and Quick Actions**
   - Implement episode preview overlay with gesture recognition
   - Add quick action buttons with immediate feedback
   - Create contextual menus for episode actions
   - Add accessibility support for all interactive elements

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize cell rendering and memory usage for large lists
   - Implement efficient image caching and loading strategies
   - Add background refresh capabilities
   - Create smooth animations and transitions

## Specification References
- `ui.md`: Episode list interface design and navigation patterns
- `content.md`: Episode metadata display and organization

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Issue #02 (Episode detail backend functionality)
- **Recommended**: SDWebImage or similar for efficient image loading

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Time Estimate**: 2 weeks  
**Story Points**: 8

## Success Metrics
- Episode lists load within 2 seconds for 100+ episodes
- Smooth scrolling maintained at 60fps during navigation
- Image loading doesn't block UI interaction
- Zero crashes during large list navigation

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: List data source logic and image loading
- **Integration Tests**: Backend episode data integration
- **UI Tests**: Navigation flows and responsive design
- **Performance Tests**: Large list scrolling and memory usage
