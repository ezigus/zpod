# Issue 03.1.2: Advanced Playback Controls and Audio Enhancement

## Priority
High

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement advanced playback controls including custom skip intervals, playback speed control, silence skipping, and sleep timer functionality with comprehensive user customization.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Custom Skip Intervals and Enhanced Navigation
- **Given** I want to set custom skip intervals for rewind/fast-forward
- **When** I configure skip intervals in playback settings
- **Then** Playback buttons should skip by user-defined intervals
- **And** I should be able to set different intervals for forward and backward skipping
- **And** Skip actions should provide audio confirmation and position feedback
- **And** Quick skip gestures should work on the progress bar and artwork areas

#### Scenario 2: Playback Speed Control with Fine-Tuning
- **Given** I want to adjust playback speed for optimal listening
- **When** I access playback speed controls
- **Then** I should have access to playback speed controls (0.8x to 5.0x range)
- **And** Speed adjustment should be available in fine increments (0.1x steps)
- **And** Speed changes should be smooth without audio artifacts
- **And** Speed settings should be saveable per-podcast or globally

#### Scenario 3: Skip Silence with Custom Threshold
- **Given** Episode is playing with silence detection enabled
- **When** I adjust silence detection threshold in playback settings
- **Then** App should skip silences based on user-defined sensitivity
- **And** I should be able to see when silence skipping occurs with visual feedback
- **And** Skip silence should work in background and preserve accurate progress tracking
- **And** Settings should allow enabling/disabling per-podcast or globally

#### Scenario 4: Sleep Timer with Shake to Reset
- **Given** Episode is playing and I want to use sleep timer
- **When** I activate "Sleep timer" and set duration (5min to 2hr options)
- **Then** Playback should stop after timer expires or episode ends (whichever comes first)
- **And** When sleep timer is active and I shake the device, timer should reset to original duration
- **And** Timer should show remaining time and provide warnings (5min, 1min remaining)
- **And** I should be able to cancel or extend timer before expiration

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Advanced Controls Foundation (Week 1)
1. **Custom Skip Intervals**
   - Create skip interval configuration interface with preset and custom options
   - Implement different forward/backward skip intervals
   - Add gesture-based skipping on artwork and progress bar
   - Create audio and haptic feedback for skip actions

2. **Playback Speed Control**
   - Implement fine-grained speed control with 0.1x increments
   - Add speed adjustment UI with quick presets and fine-tuning slider
   - Create smooth speed transitions without audio artifacts
   - Add per-podcast speed preference storage

### Phase 2: Smart Audio Features (Week 2)
1. **Silence Skipping Engine**
   - Implement intelligent silence detection with adjustable sensitivity
   - Create visual feedback when silence skipping occurs
   - Add background processing for silence detection
   - Create per-podcast and global setting management

2. **Sleep Timer and Smart Controls**
   - Implement sleep timer with multiple duration options
   - Add shake gesture detection for timer reset functionality
   - Create timer warnings and extension options
   - Add smart timer features like fade-out and chapter-aware stopping

- `playback.md`: Advanced playback controls and audio processing
- `customization.md`: Per-podcast settings and user preferences
- `ui.md`: Advanced control interface patterns

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Issue #03 (Playback engine backend functionality)
- **Required**: Core Motion framework for shake detection
- **Recommended**: Audio processing capabilities for silence detection

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Time Estimate**: 2 weeks  
**Story Points**: 11

## Success Metrics
- Playback speed changes apply within 200ms without artifacts
- Silence skipping accuracy exceeds 90% with minimal false positives
- Sleep timer activates and resets reliably with shake gesture
- Custom skip intervals work accurately across all playback scenarios

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Skip interval logic and speed control algorithms
- **Integration Tests**: Audio processing and sleep timer functionality
- **UI Tests**: Advanced control interface and gesture recognition
- **Performance Tests**: Audio processing efficiency during enhanced playback
