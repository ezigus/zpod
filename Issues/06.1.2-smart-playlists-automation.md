## Description
Implement intelligent smart playlist creation with complex criteria, automatic updates, and advanced filtering capabilities. This provides automated content curation that keeps playlists current and relevant based on user-defined rules and listening patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Advanced Smart Playlist Configuration and Automation
- **Given** I want to create automated playlists that stay current with my content
- **When** I create and configure smart playlists with complex criteria
- **Then** I should be able to set multiple criteria: podcast, play status, date ranges, duration, rating, tags
- **And** I should be able to combine multiple criteria using AND/OR/NOT logic with grouping
- **And** Smart playlists should update automatically when episodes match criteria, with real-time refresh
- **And** I should be able to set maximum episode limits, sort orders, and automatic refresh frequencies
- **And** Advanced criteria should include listening history, social recommendations, and content analysis

#### Scenario 2: Playlist Analytics and Insights
- **Given** I want to understand playlist usage and optimize my content organization
- **When** I access playlist analytics and usage insights
- **Then** I should see comprehensive playlist statistics including play counts, completion rates, and skip patterns
- **And** I should see insights about which episodes perform best in playlists and why
- **And** Analytics should suggest playlist optimizations based on listening behavior and engagement data
- **And** I should be able to export playlist data for external analysis and backup purposes
- **And** Insights should help me discover underutilized content and optimize playlist organization
