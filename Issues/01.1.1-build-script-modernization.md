# Issue 01.1.1: Build Script Modernization & Environment Abstraction

## Priority
High

## Status
ðŸª“ Split Into Sub-Issues

## Description
Original umbrella tracker for modernising the build/test tooling. The scope now lives in dedicated sub-issues:

- **Issue 01.1.1.1 â€“ Build Script Core Refactor (Modular Utilities)** (GitHub #63)
- **Issue 01.1.1.2 â€“ CI Workflow & Environment Integration** (GitHub #64)

Refer to those issues for current acceptance criteria, implementation notes, and status updates. This parent record remains for historical context and cross-linking only.

_legacy note_: Earlier plans mentioned follow-on automation (e.g. expanded download/build packaging). Those will be scheduled independently once the two sub-issues close.

## Specification References

- `ui.md`: Developer workflow and tooling UX
- `issues-review.md`: Documentation standards for tooling updates

## Dependencies

## Testing Strategy
