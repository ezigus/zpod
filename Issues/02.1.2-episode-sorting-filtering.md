## Priority
High

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement advanced episode sorting, filtering capabilities, and smart episode lists with persistent preferences and search functionality across episode content.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Advanced Episode Sorting and Filtering
- **Given** I am viewing a podcast's episode list
- **When** I tap the sort/filter button
- **Then** I should be able to sort by: publication date (newest/oldest), duration, play status, download status, rating
- **And** I should be able to filter by: unplayed, downloaded, favorited, in-progress, bookmarked, archived
- **And** I should be able to combine multiple filters with AND/OR logic
- **And** Applied filters should be visually indicated and persistent per podcast
- **And** I should be able to save custom filter combinations as "Smart Episode Lists"

#### Scenario 2: Episode Search and Content Discovery
- **Given** I want to find specific episodes across my subscriptions
- **When** I use the episode search functionality
- **Then** Search functionality should work across episode titles, descriptions, and show notes
- **And** Search should support advanced queries with boolean operators
- **And** I should be able to search within a specific podcast or across all episodes
- **And** Search results should highlight matching terms and provide context
- **And** Recent searches should be saved and easily accessible

#### Scenario 3: Smart Episode Lists and Automation
- **Given** I want automated organization of episodes based on criteria
- **When** I create smart episode lists
- **Then** Smart lists should automatically update based on rules like "unplayed episodes from last week"
- **And** I should be able to create complex rules combining play status, date, duration, and ratings
- **And** Smart lists should appear in a dedicated section with easy access
- **And** Rules should be editable and lists should update in real-time

#### Scenario 4: Filter Persistence and User Preferences
- **Given** I have configured specific filters for different podcasts
- **When** I navigate between podcasts and return
- **Then** My filter preferences should be remembered per podcast
- **And** Global filter preferences should apply to new podcasts by default
- **And** I should be able to clear all filters quickly
- **And** Filter state should sync across devices via iCloud

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Sorting and Filtering Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. **Core Filtering Engine**
   - Create flexible filtering system with multiple criteria support
   - Implement sorting algorithms for various episode attributes
   - Add filter combination logic with AND/OR operations
   - Create filter persistence using Core Data or UserDefaults

2. **Filter Interface Design**
   - Create intuitive filter/sort interface with clear visual indicators
   - Implement filter chips showing active filters
   - Add quick filter buttons for common scenarios
   - Create filter reset and management options

### Phase 2: Advanced Features and Search (Week 2)
1. **Episode Search Implementation**
   - Implement full-text search across episode metadata
   - Add search highlighting and result ranking
   - Create search history and suggestion functionality
   - Add advanced search query support

2. **Smart Lists and Automation**
   - Create smart list rule builder interface
   - Implement automatic list updates based on criteria changes
   - Add smart list management and organization
   - Create predefined smart list templates

## Specification References
- `content.md`: Episode organization and filtering requirements
- `customization.md`: User preferences and personalization
- `ui.md`: Advanced filtering interface patterns

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Issue #02 (Episode detail backend functionality)
- **Required**: Core Data or equivalent for filter persistence
- **Recommended**: Full-text search capabilities

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Time Estimate**: 2 weeks  
**Story Points**: 10

## Success Metrics
- Filter operations complete within 1 second for 500+ episodes
- Search results appear within 2 seconds across full library
- Smart lists update automatically within 5 seconds of criteria changes
- Filter preferences persist correctly across app sessions

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Filtering algorithms and search accuracy
- **Integration Tests**: Filter persistence and cloud sync
- **UI Tests**: Filter interface usability and search workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Filtering performance with large episode libraries
