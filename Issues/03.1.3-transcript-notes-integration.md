# Issue 03.1.3: Interactive Transcript and Episode Notes Integration

## Priority
Medium

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement interactive transcript view with synchronized navigation, episode notes display, and enhanced content discovery features within the player interface.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Enhanced Transcript View with Interactive Navigation
- **Given** Episode has transcript data available
- **When** I access "Transcript View" from player interface
- **Then** I should see scrollable transcript text synchronized with playback position
- **And** Tapping any line in transcript should jump to that timestamp in audio
- **And** Current speaking position should be highlighted and auto-scroll to stay visible
- **And** I should be able to search within transcript for specific terms or phrases

#### Scenario 2: Episode Notes and Rich Content Display
- **Given** Episode has show notes or additional content
- **When** I access "Episode Notes" from player interface
- **Then** I should see formatted show notes with links, images, and rich content
- **And** Links should open appropriately (in-app browser or external apps)
- **And** Images and media content should be displayed inline with proper formatting
- **And** Show notes should support markdown or HTML formatting for rich presentation

#### Scenario 3: Content Search and Navigation
- **Given** I want to find specific content within episode materials
- **When** I use search functionality in transcript or notes
- **Then** Search should work across both transcript and episode notes simultaneously
- **And** Search results should be highlighted with easy navigation between matches
- **And** Tapping transcript search results should jump to audio position
- **And** Search should support phrase matching and contextual results

#### Scenario 4: Transcript Export and Sharing
- **Given** I want to share or save transcript content
- **When** I use transcript sharing features
- **Then** I should be able to share selected transcript portions with timestamp links
- **And** I should be able to export full transcripts in text format
- **And** Shared content should include proper attribution and episode information
- **And** Timestamp links should deep-link back to specific playback positions

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Transcript Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. **Interactive Transcript Display**
   - Create scrollable transcript view with playback synchronization
   - Implement tap-to-seek functionality with accurate timestamp mapping
   - Add real-time highlight of current speaking position
   - Create smooth auto-scrolling that follows playback progress

2. **Transcript Search and Navigation**
   - Implement full-text search within transcript content
   - Add search result highlighting and navigation controls
   - Create contextual search results with surrounding text
   - Add search history and quick search suggestions

### Phase 2: Enhanced Content Features (Week 2)
1. **Episode Notes Integration**
   - Create rich content display for episode notes and show links
   - Implement markdown/HTML rendering with proper formatting
   - Add inline media display for images and embedded content
   - Create in-app browser for external links with proper navigation

2. **Content Sharing and Export**
   - Implement transcript selection and sharing with timestamp preservation
   - Add full transcript export functionality
   - Create deep-linking for shared content with playback position
   - Add proper attribution and metadata for shared content

## Specification References
- `content.md`: Transcript and episode notes requirements
- `playback.md`: Synchronized navigation and timestamp integration
- `ui.md`: Rich content display and interactive navigation patterns

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Issue #03 (Playback engine for timestamp synchronization)
- **Required**: Transcript data source (WebVTT, SRT, or custom format)
- **Recommended**: Rich text rendering capabilities
- **Optional**: Web view framework for rich content display

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Time Estimate**: 2 weeks  
**Story Points**: 9

## Success Metrics
- Transcript synchronization accuracy within 500ms of playback position
- Search results appear within 1 second across full transcript
- Tap-to-seek accuracy within 1 second of intended position
- Rich content renders properly across various episode note formats

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Transcript parsing and timestamp synchronization
- **Integration Tests**: Playback engine integration and search functionality
- **UI Tests**: Interactive navigation and content display
- **Performance Tests**: Large transcript handling and real-time synchronization
