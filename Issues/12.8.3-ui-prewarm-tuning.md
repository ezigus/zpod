# Issue 12.8.3: Trim UI Pre-Warm Duration

## Priority
Low

## Status
Open

## Description
Each UI job currently performs multi-step pre-warm (bootstatus, SpringBoard wait, accessibility server spin-up) that can consume ~30–60s. Investigate reducing or making this conditional (e.g., shorter waits with retry-on-first-launch failure) to cut idle time without hurting stability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Measure current pre-warm timing per UI job.
- [ ] Experiment with shorter waits or conditional early exit when services are already up.
- [ ] Verify no increase in first-test failures related to app launch or accessibility readiness across at least two UI suites.
- [ ] Document the chosen pre-warm sequence and time savings.

## Rationale / Links
- CI run 21566904369: pre-warm logged between restore and test start for every UI job.

## Testing Strategy
- Run a small subset (e.g., SwipePresetSelectionTests) with tuned pre-warm to validate stability.
- Compare job durations before/after change on a branch.
