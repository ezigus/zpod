# Issue 07.1.2: Intelligent Tagging System

## Priority
Medium

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement comprehensive tagging system with custom tag creation, hierarchical tag relationships, intelligent auto-tagging suggestions, and content-based tag recommendations. This provides flexible metadata-based organization beyond folder structures.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Intelligent Tagging System and Content Classification
- **Given** I want to organize content with flexible tags and metadata
- **When** I create and apply comprehensive tagging systems
- **Then** I should be able to create custom tags with names, colors, icons, and hierarchical relationships
- **And** I should be able to apply multiple tags to podcasts, episodes, and even specific segments or bookmarks
- **And** Tags should be searchable, filterable, and auto-suggested based on content analysis and usage patterns
- **And** I should see intelligent tag suggestions based on episode content, transcript analysis, and community patterns
- **And** The system should support tag hierarchies, synonyms, and automatic tag merging for better organization

#### Scenario 2: Smart Tag Automation and AI-Powered Suggestions
- **Given** I have established tagging patterns and want automated assistance
- **When** I add new content or need tagging suggestions
- **Then** The app should suggest appropriate tags based on content analysis and listening patterns
- **And** I should be able to set up automatic tagging rules for new episodes and podcasts
- **And** Tag suggestions should improve based on my tagging decisions and patterns
- **And** Bulk tagging tools should help apply tags to large content collections efficiently
- **And** Content analysis should identify topics, themes, and genres for intelligent tag suggestions

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Tagging Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. **Tag Creation and Management**
   - Create custom tag creation with names, colors, icons, and descriptions
   - Implement tag hierarchy system with parent-child relationships
   - Add tag search and filtering capabilities
   - Create tag merging and synonym management tools

2. **Tag Application System**
   - Implement multi-tag application to podcasts, episodes, and segments
   - Add tag search and auto-complete functionality
   - Create tag visualization and management interface
   - Add bulk tagging operations for efficient organization

### Phase 2: Intelligent Tagging and Automation (Week 2)
1. **Smart Tag Suggestions**
   - Implement content analysis for automatic tag suggestions
   - Add machine learning for improved tag recommendations
   - Create community-based tag pattern recognition
   - Add transcript analysis for topic-based tagging

2. **Tagging Automation**
   - Create automatic tagging rules based on content patterns
   - Implement smart tag suggestion learning from user behavior
   - Add bulk tag operations with intelligent selection
   - Create tag analytics and optimization recommendations

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Issue #07 (Content Organization Core backend functionality)
- **Required**: Issue #07.1.1 (Folder management for integration)
- **Recommended**: Content analysis and machine learning frameworks
- **Recommended**: Transcript analysis capabilities

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Time Estimate**: 2 weeks  
**Story Points**: 11

## Success Metrics
- Tag creation and application completes within 300ms
- Tag suggestions achieve 70% accuracy for user acceptance
- Content analysis generates relevant tag suggestions for 80% of episodes
- Bulk tagging operations handle 500+ items without performance degradation
