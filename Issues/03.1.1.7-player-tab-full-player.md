# Issue 03.1.1.7: Player Tab Uses Full Player View

**Status**: 🆕 Proposed

**Priority**: High

**Parent**: 03.1.1 Core Player Interface

**GitHub Issue**: [#286](https://github.com/ezigus/zpod/issues/286)

## Description
Replace the existing Player tab's simplified player UI with the full player interface. The app should present a single full player surface in the Player tab, avoiding duplicate player screens.

## Background
The app currently has a simplified player in the Player tab and a separate expanded player. This duplicates UI and causes inconsistent behavior. The Player tab should always show the full player view so there is a single, consistent destination for playback controls and metadata.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Player Tab Shows Full Player
- **Given** I select the Player tab
- **When** The tab is displayed
- **Then** The full player interface is shown
- **And** The simplified/duplicate player UI is not shown

### Scenario 2: Full Player Works Without Active Playback
- **Given** No episode is playing
- **When** I open the Player tab
- **Then** The full player shows a neutral empty state
- **And** The UI remains fully accessible

### Scenario 3: State Synchronization with Mini-Player
- **Given** Playback is active
- **When** I open the Player tab or expand from the mini-player
- **Then** The full player reflects the same playback state (episode, position, play/pause)

### Scenario 4: Presentation Consistency
- **Given** The full player is open in the Player tab
- **When** I switch to another tab
- **Then** The mini-player returns to its prior presentation state (collapsed pill or expanded mini-player)

## Implementation Notes
- Reuse `ExpandedPlayerView` inside the Player tab instead of the current placeholder player UI.
- Consider a configuration flag to hide the drag indicator when embedded in the tab (vs. sheet).
- Ensure the same `ExpandedPlayerViewModel` instance observes the shared playback service.

## Spec References
- `zpod/spec/spec.md` (User Interface and Experience: Player tab shows full player)

## Dependencies
- `03.1.1.2-expanded-player-layout` (full player UI)
- `03.1.1.6-mini-player-pill-reveal` (presentation state coordination)
- `03.3.7-player-tab-playback-wiring` (Player tab uses real playback service)

## Testing Strategy
- UI test verifying Player tab loads the full player interface.
- UI test verifying empty state when no playback is active.
- UI test verifying playback state sync between mini-player and Player tab.

## Deliverables
- Player tab renders the full player view.
- Placeholder Player tab UI removed.
- Updated UI tests and `zpodUITests/TestSummary.md`.
