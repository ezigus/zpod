# Issue 13.1: Sleep Timer and Smart Controls UI

## Priority
Low

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement comprehensive sleep timer and smart control interfaces including customizable timers, shake-to-reset functionality, and intelligent playback controls. This builds on sleep/alarm enhancements (Issue #17) to provide complete bedtime and smart listening features.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Sleep Timer Configuration
- **Given** I want to fall asleep while listening
- **When** I configure the sleep timer
- **Then** I should be able to set timer durations from 5 minutes to 2 hours
- **And** I should be able to choose from preset times (15, 30, 45, 60 minutes) or set custom durations
- **And** The timer should show remaining time and allow easy adjustments during playback
- **And** I should be able to set the timer to stop at the end of the current episode or chapter

#### Scenario 2: Smart Timer Features
- **Given** I have an active sleep timer
- **When** I use smart timer features
- **Then** I should be able to shake my device to add 5-15 minutes to the timer
- **And** The timer should gradually fade out audio instead of abruptly stopping
- **And** I should be able to set smart wake detection that pauses if I'm still awake
- **And** Timer settings should be remembered for future use with personalized defaults

#### Scenario 3: Bedtime Mode Integration
- **Given** I use the app for bedtime listening
- **When** I enable bedtime mode
- **Then** The interface should switch to a dark, minimal design optimized for low light
- **And** Controls should be larger and easier to access in the dark
- **And** The app should integrate with iOS bedtime and Do Not Disturb features
- **And** Bedtime mode should automatically enable sleep timer with my preferred settings

#### Scenario 4: Smart Playback Controls
- **Given** I want intelligent playback assistance
- **When** I use smart controls
- **Then** The app should learn my listening patterns and suggest optimal timer durations
- **And** I should be able to set automatic episode queuing that respects my sleep schedule
- **And** Smart controls should pause playback during phone calls and resume afterward
- **And** The app should provide gentle wake-up sounds or gradual volume increase features

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Basic Sleep Timer (Week 1-2)
1. **Timer Interface**
   - Create sleep timer selection interface with presets and custom options
   - Implement timer display and countdown functionality
   - Add timer adjustment controls during active playback

2. **Timer Integration**
   - Integrate timer with playback engine for smooth audio stopping
   - Implement fade-out effects and gradual volume reduction
   - Add timer persistence across app backgrounds and device locks

### Phase 2: Smart Timer Features (Week 2-3)
1. **Shake-to-Reset**
   - Implement device motion detection for timer extension
   - Add configurable shake sensitivity and extension duration
   - Create visual and haptic feedback for shake actions

2. **Intelligent Features**
   - Add end-of-episode and end-of-chapter timer options
   - Implement smart wake detection using device sensors
   - Create personalized timer suggestions based on usage patterns

### Phase 3: Bedtime Mode (Week 3)
1. **Bedtime Interface**
   - Create dark, minimal interface design for bedtime use
   - Implement large, accessible controls for dark environments
   - Add bedtime mode toggle and automatic activation

2. **System Integration**
   - Integrate with iOS bedtime and Do Not Disturb features
   - Add Focus mode integration for sleep-focused listening
   - Implement automatic bedtime settings activation

### Phase 4: Advanced Smart Controls (Week 4)
1. **Learning and Automation**
   - Implement usage pattern learning for timer suggestions
   - Add automatic episode queuing with sleep schedule awareness
   - Create smart playlist generation for bedtime listening

2. **Additional Features**
   - Add call interruption handling with smart resume
   - Implement gentle wake-up features and alarm integration
   - Create sleep quality tracking integration if applicable

- `settings.md`: Sleep timer preferences and bedtime mode configuration
- `advanced.md`: Smart features and system integration

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Issue #17 (Sleep/Alarm Enhancements backend)
- **Required**: Issue #03 (Playback engine for timer integration)
- **Optional**: Issue #05 (Settings for sleep timer preferences)
- **Optional**: Issue #24 (Notifications for sleep-related alerts)

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Time Estimate**: 3-4 weeks  
**Story Points**: 8

## Success Metrics
1. **Feature Adoption**
   - Sleep timer is used regularly by 40%+ of bedtime listeners
   - Shake-to-reset feature is discovered and used by timer users
   - Bedtime mode is activated by evening listeners

2. **User Experience**
   - Timer settings are intuitive and quick to configure (under 30 seconds)
   - Smart features accurately predict user preferences and needs
   - Bedtime mode enhances rather than complicates the evening listening experience

3. **Technical Performance**
   - Timer accuracy is within 5 seconds of set duration
   - Shake detection is responsive but not overly sensitive
   - Audio fade-out is smooth and doesn't cause audio artifacts

## Risk Mitigation
- **Battery Usage**: Optimize sensor usage and background processing
- **Accuracy**: Ensure timer reliability across device states and interruptions
- **Usability**: Design intuitive interfaces for low-light and drowsy use
- **Privacy**: Handle sleep and motion data with appropriate privacy controls

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Timer logic, shake detection, and smart feature algorithms
2. **Integration Tests**: Playback engine integration and system feature integration
3. **UI Tests**: Complete sleep timer and bedtime mode workflows
4. **Performance Tests**: Battery usage and accuracy under various conditions
5. **Usability Tests**: Bedtime interface effectiveness and feature discoverability
6. **Accessibility Tests**: Low-light usability and assistive technology support
