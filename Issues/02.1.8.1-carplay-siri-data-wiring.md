# Issue 02.1.8.1: CarPlay Siri Data Wiring

## Description
Enable the Siri/CarPlay pathway to surface real podcast and episode data by sharing the user's library between the main app and the `zpodIntents` extension. Persist the library in the shared app group, load it inside the intent handler, and bridge resolved identifiers back into the playback engine so Siri voice commands can start or queue episodes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Podcast and episode snapshots are persisted to the shared app group (`group.us.zig.zpod`) whenever the library updates.
- `PlayMediaIntentHandler` loads snapshots from the app group and returns concrete `INMediaItem`s for Siri queries (podcast titles, episode titles, "latest" requests).
- Resolved media identifiers trigger playback or queue actions in the host app when Siri invokes the intent.
- Unit tests cover snapshot persistence/decoding, fuzzy search ranking, and identifier hand-off logic.
- Regression script (`./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh`) runs successfully after adding the shared persistence code.

## Dependencies
- Requires CarPlay/Siri infrastructure from Issue 02.1.8.
- Coordinates with `PodcastManaging` to publish snapshots after subscriptions/update events.

## Spec References
- `spec/ui.md` – Navigating with CarPlay Layout & Siri integration.
- `spec/playback.md` – Siri and Shortcuts Integration.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for snapshot encoder/decoder and Siri search ranking in `SharedUtilitiesTests`.
- Intent-handling unit tests (or integration harness) using a simulated app-group container.
- Manual validation in CarPlay simulator to confirm Siri commands play the expected episode.
