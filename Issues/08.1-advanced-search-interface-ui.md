## Priority
Medium

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement comprehensive search interface with advanced filtering, result presentation, and search history management. This builds on the advanced search backend (Issue #08) to provide complete content discovery and search capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Global Search Interface
- **Given** I want to find specific content across my library
- **When** I use the search functionality
- **Then** I should be able to search across podcasts, episodes, descriptions, and transcripts
- **And** Search results should appear in real-time as I type
- **And** Results should be categorized by type (podcasts, episodes, people, topics)
- **And** Each result should show relevant context and match highlights

#### Scenario 2: Advanced Search Filters
- **Given** I need to narrow down search results
- **When** I access advanced search options
- **Then** I should be able to filter by date ranges, duration, podcast, and play status
- **And** I should be able to combine multiple filters with clear visual indicators
- **And** Filter combinations should be saveable as search presets
- **And** I should be able to search within specific folders or tags

#### Scenario 3: Search Result Management
- **Given** I have search results
- **When** I interact with the results
- **Then** I should be able to sort results by relevance, date, duration, or popularity
- **And** I should be able to preview episodes directly from search results
- **And** I should be able to perform bulk actions on search results (download, add to playlist)
- **And** Search results should remember my position when returning from episode details

#### Scenario 4: Search History and Suggestions
- **Given** I have performed searches before
- **When** I start a new search
- **Then** I should see recent search queries and quick access options
- **And** The app should suggest search terms based on my content and history
- **And** I should be able to save frequently used searches as shortcuts
- **And** Popular searches and trending topics should be discoverable

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Issue #08 (Advanced Search backend)
- **Required**: Issue #01 (Subscription management for search scope)
- **Recommended**: Issue #07 (Content organization for filtered search)
- **Optional**: Issue #19 (Transcript integration for enhanced search)

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Time Estimate**: 3-4 weeks  
**Story Points**: 13

## Success Metrics
1. **Search Performance**
   - Search results appear within 300ms for libraries up to 1000 episodes
   - Advanced filters apply within 1 second
   - Search interface remains responsive during typing

2. **Discovery Effectiveness**
   - Users find target content within 3 search refinements
   - Advanced filters are used by 40%+ of active searchers
   - Search suggestions achieve 60%+ click-through rate

3. **User Engagement**
   - Search feature is used regularly (weekly by 70%+ of active users)
   - Saved search presets are created and reused
   - Search results lead to meaningful content engagement

## Risk Mitigation
- **Search Performance**: Implement efficient indexing and caching strategies
- **Result Relevance**: Use comprehensive ranking algorithms and user feedback
- **Complexity**: Design progressive disclosure for advanced features
- **User Adoption**: Provide clear search tips and feature discovery

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Search logic, filtering algorithms, and result ranking
2. **Integration Tests**: Backend search service integration and performance
3. **UI Tests**: Complete search workflows and advanced filtering
4. **Performance Tests**: Search responsiveness with large content libraries
5. **Usability Tests**: Search feature discovery and effectiveness
6. **Accessibility Tests**: VoiceOver navigation and Voice Control search support
