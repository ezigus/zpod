## Priority
Low

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement comprehensive chapter navigation interface including visual chapter timeline, chapter-based controls, and enhanced chapter discovery. This builds on intro/outro and chapters functionality (Issue #18) to provide complete chapter-aware listening experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Visual Chapter Timeline
- **Given** I am listening to an episode with chapters
- **When** I view the chapter interface
- **Then** I should see a visual timeline showing all chapter segments with titles and durations
- **And** The current chapter should be highlighted with progress indication
- **And** I should be able to tap any chapter to jump directly to that segment
- **And** Chapter boundaries should be clearly marked on the main progress bar

#### Scenario 2: Chapter-Based Navigation
- **Given** I am in an episode with chapters
- **When** I use chapter navigation controls
- **Then** I should have dedicated previous/next chapter buttons in the player
- **And** Skip forward/backward should be chapter-aware and offer chapter boundary options
- **And** I should see chapter titles and descriptions in the player interface
- **And** Chapter navigation should work with CarPlay and external controls

#### Scenario 3: Chapter Discovery and Previews
- **Given** I want to explore episode content efficiently
- **When** I browse chapters
- **Then** I should be able to preview chapters with short audio samples
- **And** I should see chapter descriptions and key topics when available
- **And** I should be able to bookmark interesting chapters for later listening
- **And** Chapter information should be searchable across my library

#### Scenario 4: Smart Chapter Features
- **Given** I regularly listen to chaptered content
- **When** I use smart chapter features
- **Then** The app should learn my chapter preferences and suggest relevant segments
- **And** I should be able to skip intro/outro segments automatically based on preferences
- **And** The app should provide chapter-based recommendations and similar content discovery
- **And** I should be able to create custom chapter-based playlists and collections

## Specification References
- `playback.md`: Chapter navigation and intro/outro handling
- `ui.md`: Chapter interface design and timeline visualization
- `content.md`: Chapter metadata and content organization
- `advanced.md`: Smart chapter features and automation

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Issue #18 (Intro/Outro & Chapters UI backend)
- **Required**: Issue #03 (Playback engine for chapter integration)
- **Optional**: Issue #08 (Advanced search for chapter search integration)
- **Optional**: Issue #11 (Bookmarks for chapter bookmarking)

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Time Estimate**: 3-4 weeks  
**Story Points**: 8

## Success Metrics
1. **Feature Utilization**
   - Chapter navigation is used by 60%+ of users with chaptered content
   - Chapter timeline interaction improves content discovery and engagement
   - Smart chapter features are adopted and provide value to regular users

2. **Navigation Efficiency**
   - Users can navigate to specific chapters within 3 taps or interactions
   - Chapter-aware controls reduce time spent seeking within episodes
   - Chapter previews help users find relevant content faster

3. **User Experience**
   - Chapter interface is intuitive and doesn't interfere with standard playback
   - Visual timeline accurately represents chapter structure and progress
   - Smart features enhance rather than complicate the listening experience

## Risk Mitigation
- **Content Availability**: Design graceful fallbacks for episodes without chapter information
- **UI Complexity**: Use progressive disclosure and optional chapter features
- **Performance**: Optimize chapter data loading and timeline rendering
- **Compatibility**: Ensure chapter features work across different content sources

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Chapter navigation logic, timeline calculations, and smart feature algorithms
2. **Integration Tests**: Playback engine integration and external control support
3. **UI Tests**: Complete chapter navigation and discovery workflows
4. **Performance Tests**: Chapter timeline rendering and large chapter list handling
5. **Content Tests**: Various chapter formats and metadata quality handling
6. **Accessibility Tests**: Chapter navigation with assistive technologies
