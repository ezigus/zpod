# Issue 03.1.1.2: Expanded Player Layout & Interaction

**GitHub Issue**: [#109](https://github.com/ezigus/zpod/issues/109)

## Priority
High

## Status
ðŸ†• Proposed

## Description
Implement the full-screen player interface that the mini-player expands into. This work establishes the visual hierarchy (artwork, metadata, progress slider) and the fundamental interaction model for essential controls, without yet layering on advanced effects handled by Issue 03.1.2.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Expanded player presents large artwork, episode & podcast metadata, playback timeline, and core controls (play/pause, skip forward/back, scrubber).
- Smooth animated transition from mini-player to expanded view and back, respecting iOS gesture conventions.
- Progress slider tracks playback position in real time and supports scrubbing with haptic feedback.
- Layout adapts to portrait/landscape orientations and large-screen devices (iPad split view minimal support).
- Visual design follows current design tokens (typography, spacing, colors) and passes basic accessibility contrast checks.

## Implementation Notes
- Build SwiftUI-based expanded player view connected to the shared playback view model.
- Reuse or extend existing design system components (buttons, typography) for consistency.
- Wrap transition in matched geometry or custom animation to keep 60fps on modern devices.
- Coordinate orientation changes and safe-area insets, especially around Dynamic Island / notch devices.

## Dependencies
- Requires mini-player shell from Issue 03.1.1.1.
- Parent epic: [#107](https://github.com/ezigus/zpod/issues/107).
- Playback engine must expose position updates and duration metadata.

## Testing Strategy
- Snapshot tests for key breakpoints (small, medium, large artwork)
- UI tests validating expand/collapse gesture and scrubber interaction.
- Unit tests ensuring play/pause binding and timeline formatting logic operate as expected.

## Deliverables
- Expanded player SwiftUI view with animations.
- Updated navigation coordinator to manage modal/full-screen presentation.
- Accompanying tests and documentation updates.
