# Issue 28.1.14 - Streaming: Seeking and Range Requests

**Status:** OPEN
**Priority:** Medium
**Category:** Feature / Testing
**Created:** 2026-02-16
**Parent Issue:** 28.1

## Description

Implement and test seeking behavior during streaming playback, including HTTP Range request support for efficient seeking and resume-from-position.

## Spec Scenarios (from `spec/streaming-playback.md`)

1. **Seeking within buffered range** — seek completes in <100ms without new network request
2. **Seeking outside buffered range** — triggers new HTTP request, completes in <2s
3. **HTTP Range Request headers** — integration test verifying Range headers sent for seeking and resume

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Seeking within buffered range resolves without network request
- [ ] Seeking outside buffered range triggers Range request with correct byte offset
- [ ] Resume-from-position uses Range headers (not re-download from start)
- [ ] Integration tests validate Range header generation

## Dependencies

- Requires: Issue 28.1 (streaming infrastructure)
- Related: Issue 28.1.13 (current streaming tests)
