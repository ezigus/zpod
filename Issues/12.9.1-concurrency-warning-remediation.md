# Issue 12.9.1 - Concurrency Warning Remediation

## Description
Address Swift concurrency warnings emitted during build/test runs for Sendable violations and actor isolation crossings. Current warnings include unsafe notification usage and non-Sendable publishers crossing actor boundaries.

## Acceptance Criteria
- No Swift concurrency warnings in build/test logs for:
  - `Packages/Persistence/Sources/Persistence/SmartListBackgroundManager.swift` (notification send)
  - `Packages/Networking/Sources/Networking/DownloadCoordinator.swift` (non-Sendable publisher)
  - `Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/CarPlayEpisodeListController.swift` (logger used in Sendable closure)
- Concurrency fixes preserve behavior and align with strict Swift 6.1.2 rules.
- Updates include inline rationale for any `@unchecked Sendable` or actor boundary adjustments.

## Spec References
- N/A (build hygiene / compiler warnings)

## Dependencies
- None.

## Testing Strategy
- Run targeted build or tests that surface warnings:
  - `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -b zpod`
  - `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -t IntegrationTests`
- Confirm warnings no longer appear in `TestResults/*.log`.
