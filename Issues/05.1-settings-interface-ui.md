## Priority
Medium

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement comprehensive settings interface with hierarchical navigation, real-time preference updates, and integration with all app functionality. This builds on the settings framework (Issue #05) to provide complete user customization and configuration capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Settings Navigation and Organization
- **Given** I want to configure app preferences
- **When** I navigate to the Settings tab or access settings from profile
- **Then** I should see well-organized settings categories (Playback, Downloads, Appearance, etc.)
- **And** Tapping a category should navigate to detailed settings with proper back navigation
- **And** Settings should be grouped logically with clear section headers
- **And** Search functionality should help me find specific settings quickly

#### Scenario 2: Playback Settings Configuration
- **Given** I am in playback settings
- **When** I modify playback preferences
- **Then** I should be able to configure default playback speed (0.8x to 2.0x)
- **And** I should be able to set skip forward/backward intervals (10s, 15s, 30s, 45s, 60s)
- **And** I should be able to enable/disable continuous playback and auto-play next episode
- **And** Changes should take effect immediately in the player

#### Scenario 3: Appearance and Theme Customization
- **Given** I want to customize the app appearance
- **When** I access appearance settings
- **Then** I should be able to choose between light, dark, and system themes
- **And** I should be able to adjust accent colors from available options
- **And** I should be able to configure icon appearance if supported
- **And** Changes should be reflected immediately throughout the app

#### Scenario 4: Per-Podcast Settings Management
- **Given** I have subscribed to podcasts
- **When** I access per-podcast settings from a podcast details page
- **Then** I should be able to override global settings for specific podcasts
- **And** I should see clear indicators when settings differ from global defaults
- **And** I should be able to reset to global defaults easily
- **And** Settings should include: auto-download, playback speed, skip intervals, notifications

- `ui.md`: Settings interface design patterns
- `playback.md`: Playback-related settings and preferences

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Issue #05 (Settings Framework backend)
- **Required**: Issue #01 (Subscription management for per-podcast settings)
- **Recommended**: Issue #03 (Playback engine for playback settings integration)
- **Optional**: Issue #15 (Cloud sync for settings synchronization)

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Time Estimate**: 3-4 weeks  
**Story Points**: 8

## Success Metrics
1. **Usability Metrics**
   - Users can find and modify settings within 3 taps
   - Settings changes take effect immediately without app restart
   - Settings search returns relevant results in under 1 second

2. **Functionality Metrics**
   - All settings persist correctly across app restarts
   - Per-podcast settings override global settings reliably
   - Theme changes are applied consistently throughout the app

3. **Accessibility Metrics**
   - Settings interface supports VoiceOver navigation
   - Dynamic Type scaling works across all settings screens
   - Color contrast meets accessibility standards in all themes

## Risk Mitigation
- **Settings Complexity**: Use progressive disclosure and logical grouping
- **Performance**: Implement efficient settings validation and storage
- **User Confusion**: Provide clear descriptions and help text for complex settings
- **Data Consistency**: Ensure settings synchronization across app components

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Settings validation logic and state management
2. **Integration Tests**: Settings framework integration across all app features
3. **UI Tests**: Complete settings navigation and configuration workflows
4. **Accessibility Tests**: VoiceOver and Dynamic Type compliance
5. **Persistence Tests**: Settings storage and retrieval across app lifecycle
6. **Per-Podcast Tests**: Settings inheritance and override functionality
