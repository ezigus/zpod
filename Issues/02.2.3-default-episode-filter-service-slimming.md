# Issue 02.2.3: DefaultEpisodeFilterService Slimming

## Description
`Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/DefaultEpisodeFilterService` is an actor implementing extensive filtering, searching, smart list evaluation, and formatting utilities. At ~515 lines it breaks the SwiftLint `type_body_length` rule and mixes synchronous helpers with actor-isolated state. We should restructure this service into composable components while preserving the concurrency guarantees.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Identify logical groupings (e.g., filter evaluation, sorting, search highlighting) and move them into separate `Sendable` value types or helper actors.
- Leave DefaultEpisodeFilterService responsible only for orchestration and actor isolation, reducing the file below 500 lines without lint suppressions.
- Ensure new components respect concurrency annotations and avoid cross-actor `self` captures.
- Update packages consuming the service to use the new structure with no API regressions.

## Spec References
- zpod/spec/spec.md (Episode filtering scenarios at lines 114-235).
- zpod/spec/ui.md (Episode List Sorting and Filtering section at lines 139-147).
- zpod/spec/customization.md (Smart list customization scenarios at lines 79-118).

## Dependencies
- Coordinate with Issue 02.2.2 so extracted filtering logic integrates cleanly with the Library feature refactor.

## Testing Strategy
- Add unit coverage in `CoreModelsTests` for any new helper types and maintain integration checks where necessary.
- Run `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -t CoreModelsTests` plus full lint/test sweep before removing the suppression.
- Capture relevant logs in `TestResults/`.
