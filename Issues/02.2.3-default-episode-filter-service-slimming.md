# Issue 02.2.3: DefaultEpisodeFilterService Slimming

**GitHub Issue**: [#71](https://github.com/ezigus/zpod/issues/71)

## Description
`DefaultEpisodeFilterService` still lives inside `Packages/CoreModels/Sources/CoreModels/EpisodeFilterService.swift` and remains a 700+ line actor with a `// swiftlint:disable type_body_length` directive. Over the past refactors we centralized filter configuration here, but no decomposition has occurred yet. This issue updates the scope to reflect the current file layout while preserving the goal: break the monolith into composable, Sendable collaborators that keep concurrency guarantees intact.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Carve the actor into smaller units (e.g., `EpisodeFilterEvaluator`, `SortDescriptorBuilder`, search/highlight helpers) while keeping the public API stable.
- Reduce `DefaultEpisodeFilterService` below the SwiftLint 500-line threshold and remove the `type_body_length` suppression entirely.
- Preserve actor isolation semanticsâ€”new helpers must be `Sendable` or value types so calls across actors do not capture `self` unsafely.
- Update consumers (LibraryFeature, smart list automation, integration tests) to use the new structure without regressions.
- Document the new layout (dev log + inline comments where helpful) so future contributors understand the split.

## Spec References
- `spec/spec.md` Episode filtering scenarios (lines 114-235).
- `spec/ui.md` Episode List Sorting and Filtering (lines 139-147).
- `spec/customization.md` Smart list customization flows (lines 79-118).

## Dependencies
- Coordinate with Issue 02.2.2 (EpisodeListViewModel Modularization) to avoid duplicated filtering logic and to ensure extracted helpers integrate cleanly with the Library feature.

## Testing Strategy
- Add/adjust unit tests in `CoreModelsTests` for any new helper types; maintain integration tests for end-to-end filtering behavior.
- Run `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -t CoreModelsTests` plus full lint/test sweep (`./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -l`) before removing the suppression.
- Capture updated logs/result bundles in `TestResults/` per standard process.
