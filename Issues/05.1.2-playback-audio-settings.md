# Issue 05.1.2: Playback and Audio Settings

## Priority
High

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement comprehensive playback and audio configuration settings with per-podcast override capabilities, advanced audio processing options, and real-time audio adjustment controls. This provides users with complete control over their listening experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Default Playback Settings Configuration
- **Given** I am in "Playback" settings section
- **When** I modify default playback preferences
- **Then** I should be able to configure default playback speed (0.8x to 5.0x range)
- **And** I should be able to set skip forward/backward intervals (10s, 15s, 30s, 45s, 60s)
- **And** I should be able to enable/disable continuous playback, auto-play next episode, and shuffle
- **And** I should be able to configure skip silence detection and volume boost settings
- **And** Changes should take effect immediately and apply to all episodes unless overridden per-podcast

#### Scenario 2: Per-Podcast Settings Override Management
- **Given** I have subscribed podcasts and want podcast-specific settings
- **When** I access per-podcast settings from podcast details
- **Then** I should be able to override global settings for specific podcasts
- **And** I should see clear indicators when settings differ from global defaults
- **And** I should be able to reset individual podcasts to global defaults easily
- **And** Per-podcast settings should include: playback speed, skip intervals, auto-download, notifications
- **And** Override settings should sync across devices if cloud sync is enabled

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Global Playback Settings (Week 1)
1. **Core Playback Configuration**
   - Create playback speed selector with precise range (0.8x to 5.0x)
   - Implement skip interval configuration with common time options
   - Add continuous playback and auto-play controls
   - Create skip silence detection and volume boost settings

2. **Audio Enhancement Settings**
   - Implement volume normalization and boost configuration
   - Add audio quality preferences for different connection types
   - Create smart audio processing controls
   - Add accessibility audio features integration

### Phase 2: Per-Podcast Override System (Week 2)
1. **Podcast-Specific Settings**
   - Create per-podcast settings override interface
   - Implement clear visual indicators for overridden settings
   - Add easy reset to global defaults functionality
   - Create settings inheritance visualization

2. **Settings Synchronization**
   - Implement per-podcast settings cloud sync
   - Add conflict resolution for cross-device override changes
   - Create settings export/import for backup purposes
   - Add bulk settings management tools

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Issue #05 (Settings Core backend functionality)
- **Required**: Issue #05.1.1 (Core settings navigation)
- **Required**: Audio processing framework
- **Recommended**: Issue #03 (Player Core for integration)

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Time Estimate**: 2 weeks  
**Story Points**: 11

## Success Metrics
- Playback settings changes apply immediately to current and future episodes
- Per-podcast overrides clearly distinguished from global settings
- Settings synchronize across devices within 30 seconds via iCloud
- Audio processing settings improve listening experience for 90% of users
