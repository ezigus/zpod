# Issue 12.5: Cross-Platform Testing Support for Package Tests

## Priority
Medium - Development efficiency improvement

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Add cross-platform testing support for core packages to enable testing of platform-agnostic code on non-Apple platforms while properly excluding iOS-specific frameworks and dependencies.

## Problem Statement
Currently, the testing framework requires macOS/Xcode for all tests, but many core packages (CoreModels, FeedParsing, Networking, etc.) could be tested on other platforms if iOS-specific dependencies were properly isolated.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Package Test Isolation
- [ ] Identify platform-agnostic packages that can be tested cross-platform
- [ ] Create separate test targets for cross-platform package testing
- [ ] Exclude iOS-specific frameworks from cross-platform tests
- [ ] Add conditional compilation for platform-specific code

### Test Configuration
- [ ] Update Package.swift to support cross-platform testing
- [ ] Create platform-specific test configuration
- [ ] Add CI/CD support for cross-platform test execution
- [ ] Document cross-platform testing patterns

### Framework Enhancement
- [ ] Create mock implementations for platform-specific dependencies
- [ ] Add platform abstraction layers where needed
- [ ] Ensure test coverage remains comprehensive across platforms
- [ ] Validate that iOS-specific functionality still works properly

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Package Analysis
- Audit existing packages for platform dependencies
- Identify packages suitable for cross-platform testing
- Create dependency isolation strategy

### Phase 2: Test Target Restructuring
- Create separate test targets for cross-platform packages
- Update Package.swift with conditional compilation
- Add platform-specific mock implementations

### Phase 3: CI/CD Integration
- Add cross-platform test execution to build pipeline
- Create platform-specific test reporting
- Validate test coverage across platforms

## Specification References
- Package architecture in development guidelines
- Cross-platform compatibility requirements

## Dependencies
- Issue 12.2: Testing Framework Refactoring (completed)
- Existing package test infrastructure

## Related TODO Items
- Package.swift: Cross-platform testing support implementation

## Technical Considerations
- SwiftUI, SwiftData, and Combine must be excluded from cross-platform tests
- AVFoundation and other Apple frameworks need proper conditional compilation
- Mock implementations should maintain API compatibility

## Estimated Effort
Medium - Requires package restructuring and test configuration updates

## Success Metrics
- Core packages testable on multiple platforms
- Maintained test coverage for iOS-specific functionality
- Faster feedback cycles for platform-agnostic development
- Clear separation between platform-specific and agnostic code
