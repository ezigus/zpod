## Description
Implement comprehensive offline content management with clear offline indicators, multi-device synchronization, cloud integration, and cross-device download coordination. This ensures seamless access to downloaded content across all user devices with consistent synchronization.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Enhanced Offline Content Access and Management
- **Given** I have downloaded episodes and varying connectivity
- **When** I am offline, on poor connectivity, or managing offline content
- **Then** Downloaded episodes should be clearly marked as available offline with quality indicators
- **And** I should be able to play downloaded episodes without any internet dependency
- **And** Non-downloaded episodes should be disabled with clear visual indicators and helpful messaging
- **And** I should see an offline mode indicator with information about available content
- **And** I should be able to manage downloaded content entirely offline including organization and cleanup

#### Scenario 2: Cloud Integration and Multi-Device Download Sync
- **Given** I use the podcast app on multiple devices with iCloud sync enabled
- **When** I manage downloads across my devices
- **Then** Download preferences and settings should sync across all my devices
- **And** Downloaded episodes should be available on the device where they were downloaded
- **And** Download queue and priorities should stay synchronized across devices
- **And** I should be able to initiate downloads on one device and monitor progress on another
- **And** Storage usage should be tracked per device with cloud-based preference backup
