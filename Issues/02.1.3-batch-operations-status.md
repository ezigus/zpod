# Issue 02.1.3: Batch Operations and Episode Status Management

## Priority
Medium

## Status
✅ Completed – September 29, 2025

## Description
Original umbrella work item for batch episode operations and status management. This scope has now been split into dedicated sub-issues:

- **Issue 02.1.3.1 – Multi-Selection & Batch Interface Enhancements** (GitHub #61)
- **Issue 02.1.3.2 – Episode Status & Progress Visualisation** (GitHub #62)

Refer to those issues for current acceptance criteria, implementation plans, and status tracking. This parent record remains as historical context only.

_Legacy note_: The original scope referenced downstream initiatives covering sleep-timer smart controls (Issue 13.1.x) and accessibility/UI polish (Issue 15.1.x). Those remain tracked independently and should be sequenced after the Phase 2 work (Issue 02.1.3.2) when relevant.

## Resolution Summary
- Consolidated runner summary enhancements and Bash 3 portability fixes (`scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh`, supporting libs) to stabilize build/test reporting across macOS hosts.
- Captured validation evidence in `dev-log/02.1.3-batch-operations-episode-status.md` (latest update September 29, 2025) confirming regression builds and UI suites are green following summary tooling updates.
- No outstanding tasks remain for this umbrella issue; sub-issue deliverables have shipped and the parent record now serves archival context only.

## Acceptance Criteria
_Superseded – see sub-issues for up-to-date scenarios._

## Implementation Approach

## Specification References
- `content.md`: Episode status management and bulk operations
- `ui.md`: Multi-selection interface patterns and visual feedback
- `downloads.md`: Download status and progress indication

## Dependencies
- **See sub-issues for specific dependency tracking.**

## Estimated Effort
_Superseded – tracked per sub-issue._

## Success Metrics
_Superseded – tracked per sub-issue._

## Testing Strategy
Completed sub-issues cover their own detailed plans. For wrap-up validation of this parent issue:

- ✅ `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -t zpodUITests` (logs: `TestResults/TestResults_20250929_080039_test_zpodUITests.{log,xcresult}`)
- ✅ `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -t zpod` (split harness: unit logs `TestResults/TestResults_20250929_082816_test_zpod-unit.{log,xcresult}`, UI logs `TestResults/TestResults_20250929_082832_test_zpod-ui.{log,xcresult}`)
- ⚠️ `LibraryFeatureTests` remain SPM-only and are skipped on macOS hosts without iOS frameworks. Covered indirectly through workspace build + UI regression above.

Closure validation captured in dev log entry (2025-09-29 18:40 EDT) and build log `TestResults/TestResults_20250929_183544_build_zpod.log`.
