# Issue 02.1.3: Batch Operations and Episode Status Management

## Priority
Medium

## Status
üîÑ Wrap-up validation in progress

## Description
Original umbrella work item for batch episode operations and status management. This scope has now been split into dedicated sub-issues:

- **Issue 02.1.3.1 ‚Äì Multi-Selection & Batch Interface Enhancements** (GitHub #61)
- **Issue 02.1.3.2 ‚Äì Episode Status & Progress Visualisation** (GitHub #62)

Refer to those issues for current acceptance criteria, implementation plans, and status tracking. This parent record remains as historical context only.

_Legacy note_: The original scope referenced downstream initiatives covering sleep-timer smart controls (Issue 13.1.x) and accessibility/UI polish (Issue 15.1.x). Those remain tracked independently and should be sequenced after the Phase 2 work (Issue 02.1.3.2) when relevant.

## Acceptance Criteria
_Superseded ‚Äì see sub-issues for up-to-date scenarios._

## Implementation Approach
_Superseded ‚Äì see sub-issues for detailed plans._

## Specification References
- `content.md`: Episode status management and bulk operations
- `ui.md`: Multi-selection interface patterns and visual feedback
- `downloads.md`: Download status and progress indication

## Dependencies
- **See sub-issues for specific dependency tracking.**

## Estimated Effort
_Superseded ‚Äì tracked per sub-issue._

## Success Metrics
_Superseded ‚Äì tracked per sub-issue._

## Testing Strategy
Completed sub-issues cover their own detailed plans. For wrap-up validation of this parent issue:

- ‚úÖ `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -t zpodUITests` (logs: `TestResults/TestResults_20250929_080039_test_zpodUITests.{log,xcresult}`)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `LibraryFeatureTests` remain SPM-only and are skipped on macOS hosts without iOS frameworks. Covered indirectly through workspace build + UI regression above.

Next steps before closing: confirm Issue 02.1 documentation updates and run the full `zpod` scheme once simulator stability improves (tracked in PR #74).
