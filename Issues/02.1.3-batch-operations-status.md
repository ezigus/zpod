# Issue 02.1.3: Batch Operations and Episode Status Management

## Priority
Medium

## Status
ðŸª“ Split Into Sub-Issues

## Description
Original umbrella work item for batch episode operations and status management. This scope has now been split into dedicated sub-issues:

- **Issue 02.1.3.1 â€“ Multi-Selection & Batch Interface Enhancements** (GitHub #61)
- **Issue 02.1.3.2 â€“ Episode Status & Progress Visualisation** (GitHub #62)

Refer to those issues for current acceptance criteria, implementation plans, and status tracking. This parent record remains as historical context only.

_Legacy note_: The original scope referenced downstream initiatives covering sleep-timer smart controls (Issue 13.1.x) and accessibility/UI polish (Issue 15.1.x). Those remain tracked independently and should be sequenced after the Phase 2 work (Issue 02.1.3.2) when relevant.
