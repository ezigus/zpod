# Issue 02.2.2: EpisodeListViewModel Modularization

## Description
`Packages/LibraryFeature/Sources/LibraryFeature/EpisodeListViewModel.swift` exceeds 580 lines and blends filtering, batching, download progress monitoring, and UI state management. The monolithic structure complicates testing and introduces multiple responsibilities. We need to carve the logic into dedicated collaborators so the view model stays within lint limits and is easier to reason about.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Extract non-UI responsibilities (filter orchestration, batch operation coordination, download progress plumbing) into new protocol-driven services or extensions.
- EpisodeListViewModel implementation falls below the 500-line limit with no SwiftLint suppressions.
- Update SwiftUI views and tests to use the new abstractions without regressions.
- Document the new structure (dev log + inline comments where necessary) and ensure dependency injection stays @MainActor safe.

## Spec References
- zpod/spec/ui.md (Episode List Sorting and Filtering section at lines 139-147).
- zpod/spec/spec.md (Episode list personalization scenarios at lines 170-235).
- zpod/spec/customization.md (Episode list appearance/behavior scenarios at lines 54-120).

## Dependencies
- Coordinate with Issue 02.2.3 for shared filtering logic to avoid duplicate abstractions.

## Testing Strategy
- Use TDD with unit tests in `LibraryFeatureTests` for newly extracted collaborators.
- Update/extend UI snapshot or interaction tests if state changes surface new behavior.
- Validate with `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -t LibraryFeatureTests,zpod` and lint before sign-off.
