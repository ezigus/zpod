# Issue 27.1.5 - Siri Snapshot Protocol Location Review

## Priority
Medium

## Status
🔄 Planned

## Description
Investigate the appropriate module location for `SiriSnapshotRefreshing`. It currently lives in CoreModels to share between app code and TestSupport, but prior attempts to move it into a package may have failed. Determine the correct long-term placement without changing production behavior in this issue.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Document the current dependency graph and usage sites for `SiriSnapshotRefreshing`.
- Capture prior failure constraints (build errors, SwiftData macro limits, module boundary issues) with evidence or notes.
- Recommend a long-term location and rationale (CoreModels vs Persistence vs SharedUtilities vs app target).
- If relocation is recommended, outline migration steps and risks in a follow-up plan.
- Update relevant documentation/dev-log with the decision.

## Implementation Approach
1. Audit current usage of `SiriSnapshotRefreshing` across app, packages, and tests.
2. Review prior attempts and constraints (dev-log notes, CI failures, build logs).
3. Evaluate candidate locations against architecture layering and build constraints.
4. Produce a recommendation and follow-up plan if needed.

## Specification References
- `zpod/spec/customization.md#siri-ios-shortcuts-and-google-assistant-integration`
- `zpod/spec/settings.md#siri-and-shortcuts-integration`

## Dependencies
- Issue 27.1.3 (Siri snapshot parity in TestSupport)
- Issue 28.1.8 (Episode metadata persistence for Siri)

## Testing Strategy
No code changes expected in this issue. If a relocation is proposed, define test updates in the follow-up issue.

## Estimated Effort
Small (1-2 hours)

## Success Metrics
- Clear documented recommendation with rationale and constraints.
- Follow-up issue created if relocation is required.
