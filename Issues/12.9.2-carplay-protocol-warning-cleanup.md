# Issue 12.9.2 - CarPlay Protocol Warning Cleanup

## Description
Resolve CarPlay protocol conformance warnings caused by method signatures that nearly match optional protocol requirements. This includes `CPTemplateApplicationSceneDelegate` method mismatches in CarPlay scene delegates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- No protocol signature warnings for CarPlay scene delegate methods in build logs.
- CarPlay scene delegate methods match protocol requirements exactly (labels, optionality, @objc where required).
- Behavior remains unchanged for CarPlay lifecycle handling.

## Spec References
- docs/carplay/SETUP.md
- docs/carplay/HIG_COMPLIANCE.md

## Dependencies
- None.

## Testing Strategy
- Build with `./scripts/run-xcode-tests.sh -b zpod` and verify warning-free output.
- If available, run CarPlay-specific checks or smoke tests on a simulator.
