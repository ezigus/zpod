# Issue 07.1.3: Advanced Filtering and Smart Collections

## Priority
Medium

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement sophisticated filtering system with complex criteria combinations, custom view creation, smart collections that auto-update, and advanced search integration. This provides powerful tools for finding and organizing content based on multiple criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Advanced Filtering, Views, and Smart Collections
- **Given** I have organized content with folders, tags, and rich metadata
- **When** I use advanced filtering and view customization options
- **Then** I should be able to create complex filters combining folders, tags, play status, dates, ratings, and custom criteria
- **And** I should be able to create and save custom views with specific filter combinations, sort orders, and display preferences
- **And** I should be able to create smart collections that automatically update based on criteria (like smart playlists but for organization)
- **And** Filters should work across the entire library with real-time updates and performance optimization
- **And** Advanced search should integrate seamlessly with organizational structure

#### Scenario 2: Dynamic Collection Management and Automation
- **Given** I want automated content organization that stays current
- **When** I create and manage smart collections with complex criteria
- **Then** Smart collections should automatically update when content matches or stops matching criteria
- **And** I should be able to set update frequencies and notification preferences for collection changes
- **And** Collection rules should support Boolean logic (AND/OR/NOT) with grouping
- **And** Collections should have size limits and overflow handling with priority rules
- **And** I should see collection analytics showing content flow and rule effectiveness

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Advanced Filtering System (Week 1)
1. **Complex Filter Creation**
   - Create advanced filter interface with multiple criteria types
   - Implement Boolean logic (AND/OR/NOT) with visual grouping
   - Add filter combination saving and reuse functionality
   - Create real-time filter preview with performance optimization

2. **Custom View Management**
   - Implement custom view creation with filter, sort, and display preferences
   - Add view saving, sharing, and template creation
   - Create view switching and management interface
   - Add view synchronization across devices

### Phase 2: Smart Collections and Automation (Week 2)
1. **Smart Collection Engine**
   - Create smart collection creation with automated updates
   - Implement collection rule evaluation and content matching
   - Add collection size management and overflow handling
   - Create collection change notifications and history

2. **Search Integration and Analytics**
   - Integrate advanced search with organizational structure
   - Create search within specific collections and filtered views
   - Add collection analytics and rule effectiveness tracking
   - Implement collection optimization suggestions

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Issue #07 (Content Organization Core backend functionality)
- **Required**: Issue #07.1.1 (Folder management for integration)
- **Required**: Issue #07.1.2 (Tagging system for filter criteria)
- **Recommended**: Advanced search functionality

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Time Estimate**: 2 weeks  
**Story Points**: 12

## Success Metrics
- Complex filters with 5+ criteria execute within 2 seconds
- Smart collections update automatically within 5 minutes of criteria changes
- Advanced search returns relevant results within 1 second
- Custom views save and restore correctly 100% of the time
