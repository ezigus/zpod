# Issue 29.1: Clarify Actor-Aware Logging Usage

**Status**: 🆕 Proposed

**Priority**: Medium

**Parent**: 03.3.4 - Unplayable Episode UX

## Description

The shared `Logger` helper in `Packages/SharedUtilities` is actor-neutral, but several components (view models, playback engines, controllers) intentionally live on the `@MainActor`. We recently introduced `MainActorLogger.shared` to make that distinction explicit, but the codebase and documentation still need a clear, tracked plan for how each piece of code should choose between the two variants.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Update documentation (AGENTS.md, dev-logs, or other relevant guides) to describe when to use the actor-neutral `Logger` vs. `MainActorLogger.shared` and why the distinction matters.
2. Identify high-priority, MainActor-bound components that should consistently call `MainActorLogger.shared` rather than the actor-neutral `Logger`, and log those findings so the follow-up change can be scheduled.
3. Ensure any shared utilities or background helpers continue to use the actor-neutral `Logger` so they remain safe from actor hops.

## Testing

- Not applicable; this is documentation/discovery work.
