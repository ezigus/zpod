## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Advanced Sleep Timer with Intelligent Features
- **Given** I want sophisticated sleep timer functionality for bedtime listening
- **When** I configure and use advanced sleep timer features
- **Then** I should be able to set flexible timer durations including custom times, chapter-based endings, and episode completion
- **And** Smart sleep detection should learn my patterns and suggest optimal timer durations
- **And** Timer should include gentle fade-out with customizable fade duration and volume curves
- **And** Chapter integration should allow ending at natural chapter breaks for better sleep experience
- **And** Timer should pause on interruptions and resume intelligently based on context

## Implementation Approach
