# Issue 25.1: Parental Controls and Content Filtering UI

## Priority
Medium

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement comprehensive parental controls and content filtering interface allowing parents and users to restrict explicit content, set time limits, and create safe listening environments. This ensures the app is family-friendly and provides appropriate content controls.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Content Rating and Filtering Setup
- **Given** I want to set up content filtering for family use
- **When** I access parental control settings
- **Then** I should be able to enable explicit content filtering
- **And** I should be able to set content rating limits (clean, mild, explicit)
- **And** I should be able to create age-based content profiles
- **And** Filtering should apply to discovery, search, and recommendations

#### Scenario 2: Time-Based Usage Controls
- **Given** I want to limit listening time for family members
- **When** I set up time controls
- **Then** I should be able to set daily and weekly listening time limits
- **And** I should be able to set quiet hours when the app cannot be used
- **And** I should be able to set bedtime restrictions and sleep schedules
- **And** Time limit warnings and enforcement should be clear and consistent

#### Scenario 3: Content Approval and Supervision
- **Given** I want to supervise content access for family members
- **When** I enable content supervision
- **Then** I should be able to require approval for new podcast subscriptions
- **And** I should be able to review and approve/deny subscription requests
- **And** I should be able to pre-approve specific podcasts and creators
- **And** I should receive notifications for content that requires review

#### Scenario 4: Safe Mode and Protected Settings
- **Given** I want to ensure settings cannot be changed by children
- **When** I enable protected mode
- **Then** Parental control settings should require authentication to change
- **And** I should be able to set a separate parental control PIN or use biometric authentication
- **And** Safe mode should hide inappropriate content completely rather than just blocking it
- **And** Settings should be backed up and sync across family devices

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Content Filtering Foundation (Week 1-2)
1. **Content Rating System**
   - Implement content rating detection and classification
   - Create explicit content filtering engine
   - Add age-appropriate content categorization

2. **Filtering Interface**
   - Create parental control settings interface
   - Implement content rating selection and filtering
   - Add safe mode activation and management

### Phase 2: Time-Based Controls (Week 2-3)
1. **Usage Time Management**
   - Create daily and weekly time limit controls
   - Implement usage tracking and limit enforcement
   - Add time warning notifications and grace periods

2. **Schedule Management**
   - Create quiet hours and bedtime restriction settings
   - Implement schedule-based app locking
   - Add flexible scheduling with day-of-week customization

### Phase 3: Content Supervision (Week 3)
1. **Approval Workflow**
   - Create subscription approval request system
   - Implement parent notification and approval interface
   - Add pre-approved content management

2. **Supervision Dashboard**
   - Create parental dashboard for monitoring usage
   - Add content review and management tools
   - Implement activity logs and reporting

### Phase 4: Security and Protection (Week 4)
1. **Settings Protection**
   - Add authentication requirements for parental settings
   - Implement PIN and biometric protection
   - Create tamper-resistant settings storage

2. **Family Integration**
   - Add family account linking and management
   - Implement cross-device settings synchronization
   - Create family usage reporting and insights

- `discovery.md`: Content filtering in discovery and recommendations
- `ui.md`: Family-safe interface design patterns
- `customization.md`: Content filtering and user profile management

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Content rating and filtering backend system
- **Required**: Issue #05.1 (Settings interface for parental control configuration)
- **Recommended**: Issue #09.1 (Discovery interface for filtered content)
- **Optional**: Issue #19.1 (Notifications for parental approval requests)

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Time Estimate**: 3-4 weeks  
**Story Points**: 8

## Success Metrics
1. **Family Safety and Protection**
   - Explicit content is effectively filtered and blocked
   - Time limits are enforced consistently and fairly
   - Children cannot circumvent parental controls

2. **Parental Control Effectiveness**
   - Parents can easily set up and manage content filtering
   - Approval workflows work smoothly and promptly
   - Settings remain secure and tamper-resistant

3. **User Experience Balance**
   - Parental controls don't interfere with appropriate adult usage
   - Family members understand and respect usage limits
   - Content filtering is accurate and doesn't over-block appropriate content

## Risk Mitigation
- **Over-Filtering**: Ensure content filtering is accurate and doesn't block appropriate content
- **Circumvention**: Implement robust protection against settings tampering
- **Usability**: Balance protection with ease of use for both parents and children
- **Privacy**: Protect family usage data and monitoring information appropriately

## Testing Strategy
1. **Content Filtering Tests**: Verify accurate detection and blocking of inappropriate content
2. **Time Limit Tests**: Consistent enforcement of usage limits across app sessions
3. **Security Tests**: Settings protection and tamper resistance
4. **Family Workflow Tests**: Complete parental control setup and management workflows
5. **Edge Case Tests**: Boundary conditions and circumvention attempts
6. **Usability Tests**: Parent and child user experience with controls active
