## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Equalizer Interface and Presets
- **Given** I want to customize audio output quality
- **When** I access the equalizer settings
- **Then** I should see a multi-band equalizer with individual frequency band controls
- **And** I should have access to preset equalizer settings (Podcast, Music, Voice, Bass Boost, etc.)
- **And** I should be able to create and save custom equalizer presets
- **And** Changes should apply to audio output in real-time with immediate feedback

#### Scenario 2: Advanced Audio Processing
- **Given** I want enhanced audio quality
- **When** I access advanced audio settings
- **Then** I should be able to enable volume leveling and normalization
- **And** I should have access to dynamic range compression settings
- **And** I should be able to adjust pitch/tempo independently
- **And** I should have noise reduction and audio enhancement options

#### Scenario 3: Per-Podcast Audio Profiles
- **Given** Different podcasts have different audio characteristics
- **When** I set up podcast-specific audio settings
- **Then** I should be able to save audio profiles per podcast
- **And** Audio settings should automatically apply when switching between podcasts
- **And** I should be able to copy audio settings between podcasts
- **And** Global vs. per-podcast settings should be clearly indicated

#### Scenario 4: Audio Enhancement Features
- **Given** I encounter various audio quality issues
- **When** I use audio enhancement features
- **Then** I should have access to voice clarity enhancement
- **And** I should be able to reduce background noise and hiss
- **And** I should have stereo/mono audio conversion options
- **And** I should have volume boost options with safety warnings
