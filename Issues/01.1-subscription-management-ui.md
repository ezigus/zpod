## Priority
High

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement comprehensive UI for managing podcast subscriptions, including browsing, subscribing, unsubscribing, and organizing subscriptions. This builds on the backend subscription functionality from Issue #01 to provide a complete user experience for discovering and managing podcast content.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Browse and Subscribe to Podcasts
- **Given** I am on the Discover tab
- **When** I search for "Swift Talk" podcast
- **Then** I should see relevant podcast results with artwork, titles, and descriptions
- **And** I should be able to tap "Subscribe" to add the podcast to my library
- **And** The subscription should appear immediately in my Library tab

#### Scenario 2: Manage Existing Subscriptions
- **Given** I have subscribed podcasts in my library
- **When** I navigate to the Library tab
- **Then** I should see all my subscriptions organized with clear visual hierarchy
- **And** I should be able to swipe left on any subscription to reveal "Unsubscribe" option
- **And** Tapping "Unsubscribe" should remove the podcast after confirmation

#### Scenario 3: Subscription Organization
- **Given** I have multiple podcast subscriptions
- **When** I long-press on a subscription in the library
- **Then** I should be able to organize subscriptions into folders or categories
- **And** I should be able to reorder subscriptions by dragging
- **And** Changes should persist across app restarts

#### Scenario 4: Subscription Details and Settings
- **Given** I have a subscribed podcast
- **When** I tap the info button or navigate to podcast details
- **Then** I should see podcast description, episode count, and subscription date
- **And** I should be able to modify per-podcast settings (auto-download, notifications)
- **And** I should be able to view subscription history and statistics

   - Implement subscription history tracking

### Phase 3: Polish and Accessibility (Week 4)
1. **Accessibility Implementation**
   - Add VoiceOver labels and hints
   - Implement Dynamic Type support

- `customization.md`: Organization and folder management

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Issue #01 (Subscribe backend functionality)
- **Optional**: Issue #05 (Settings framework for per-podcast settings)
- **Optional**: Issue #07 (Folder/tag organization backend)

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Time Estimate**: 3-4 weeks  
**Story Points**: 13

## Success Metrics
1. **Functional Metrics**
   - Users can discover and subscribe to podcasts in under 30 seconds
   - Subscription management operations complete without crashes
   - All subscription data persists correctly across app restarts

2. **Usability Metrics**
   - Search results appear within 2 seconds of query
   - Subscription list loads within 1 second for up to 100 subscriptions
   - Swipe actions are discoverable and responsive

3. **Accessibility Metrics**
   - 100% VoiceOver navigation coverage
   - Full Dynamic Type support across all text elements
   - Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards

## Risk Mitigation
- **UI Performance**: Implement virtualization for large subscription lists
- **Search Accuracy**: Use backend search service for reliable results
- **Data Consistency**: Ensure UI updates reflect backend state changes immediately

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: ViewModel logic and state management
2. **Integration Tests**: Backend service integration
3. **UI Tests**: Full user workflows and accessibility compliance
4. **Performance Tests**: Large subscription list handling and search responsiveness
