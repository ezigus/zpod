- **When** I sign in with Apple ID and enable iCloud sync
- **Then** Subscriptions and discovery preferences should sync automatically across all devices
- **And** Folder organization and per-podcast settings should be preserved
- **And** Sync should handle conflicts intelligently (merge, newest wins, or user choice)
- **And** Offline subscription changes should sync when internet becomes available

#### Scenario 9: Parental Controls and Content Filtering
- **Given** I want to restrict explicit content or set parental controls
- **When** I enable parental controls or set content filters in settings

- **And** Content filtering should apply to discovery, search, and recommendations
- **And** I should be able to set age-based content profiles and require approval for subscriptions
- **And** Parental control settings should require authentication to change

#### Scenario 10: Accessibility for Discovery Features
- **Given** I have accessibility needs (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, high contrast)
- **When** I use discovery and subscription features
- **Then** All controls and features should be fully compatible with VoiceOver with descriptive labels
- **And** Interface should adapt to Dynamic Type settings without losing functionality
- **And** High contrast mode should be supported with appropriate color adjustments
- **And** Complex interfaces like search results should be properly structured for screen readers

#### Scenario 11: Adding Podcast by Direct RSS Feed URL
- **Given** I know the RSS feed URL of a podcast
- **When** I select "Add by RSS Feed URL" and enter the URL
- **Then** The app should validate the feed and add the podcast with proper error handling
- **And** Custom RSS feeds should support user-configurable parsing options and filters
- **And** Private or password-protected feeds should be supported with authentication
- **And** Invalid or corrupted feeds should show clear error messages with retry options
