## Priority
High

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement comprehensive download management interface including download progress tracking, queue management, storage oversight, and user controls for offline content. This builds on the download core functionality (Issue #04) to provide complete offline content management.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Download Progress and Queue Management
- **Given** I am downloading episodes
- **When** I view the downloads section
- **Then** I should see all downloads with real-time progress indicators
- **And** I should see download queue with pending, active, and completed states
- **And** I should be able to pause, resume, or cancel individual downloads
- **And** I should be able to reorder pending downloads in the queue

#### Scenario 2: Storage Management Interface
- **Given** I have downloaded content
- **When** I navigate to the storage management section
- **Then** I should see total storage used and available space
- **And** I should see storage breakdown by podcast with sizes
- **And** I should be able to delete downloaded episodes individually or in bulk
- **And** I should see storage warnings when space is low

#### Scenario 3: Auto-Download Configuration
- **Given** I want to configure automatic downloads
- **When** I access download settings
- **Then** I should be able to enable/disable auto-download per podcast
- **And** I should be able to set download quality preferences (high/medium/low)
- **And** I should be able to configure WiFi-only restrictions
- **And** I should be able to set automatic cleanup rules (keep latest N episodes)

#### Scenario 4: Offline Content Access
- **Given** I have downloaded episodes
- **When** I am offline or have poor connectivity
- **Then** Downloaded episodes should be clearly marked as available offline
- **And** I should be able to play downloaded episodes without internet
- **And** Non-downloaded episodes should be disabled with clear indicators
- **And** I should see an offline mode indicator when applicable
