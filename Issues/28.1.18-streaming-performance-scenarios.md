# Issue 28.1.18 - Streaming: Performance Scenarios

**Status:** OPEN
**Priority:** Low
**Category:** Performance / Testing
**Created:** 2026-02-16
**Parent Issue:** 28.1

## Description

Implement and test streaming performance requirements: initial buffer time, adaptive bitrate, episode preloading, and bandwidth management.

## Spec Scenarios (from `spec/streaming-playback.md`)

1. **Initial buffer time** — playback starts within 3s on good connection
2. **Adaptive bitrate** — quality adjusts to available bandwidth
3. **Episode preloading** — next episode in queue begins buffering before current ends
4. **Bandwidth monitoring** — streaming adapts to measured throughput

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Initial buffer time measured and within 3s target on good network
- [ ] Quality degrades gracefully on constrained bandwidth
- [ ] Preloading triggers N seconds before episode end
- [ ] Performance metrics logged for monitoring

## Dependencies

- Requires: Issue 28.1 (streaming infrastructure)
- Related: NetworkMonitor, AVPlayerPlaybackEngine
