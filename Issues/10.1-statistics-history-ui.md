## Description
Implement comprehensive listening statistics and history interface including visual analytics, listening patterns, and progress tracking. This builds on the listening history backend (Issue #13) to provide complete listening insights and analytics.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Listening Statistics Dashboard
- **Given** I have listening history data
- **When** I access the statistics section
- **Then** I should see a dashboard with total listening time, episodes completed, and active streaks
- **And** I should see visual charts showing listening patterns over time (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **And** Statistics should include top podcasts, favorite genres, and listening habits
- **And** I should be able to filter statistics by date ranges and specific podcasts

#### Scenario 2: Detailed History Browser
- **Given** I want to review my listening history
- **When** I access the history section
- **Then** I should see a chronological list of all played episodes with timestamps
- **And** Each history entry should show episode title, podcast, duration, and completion percentage
- **And** I should be able to search and filter my history by podcast, date, or completion status
- **And** I should be able to replay episodes directly from history with preserved progress

#### Scenario 3: Progress and Achievement Tracking
- **Given** I am building listening habits
- **When** I view progress tracking
- **Then** I should see progress toward listening goals and achievements
- **And** I should see streak counters for consecutive listening days
- **And** The app should celebrate milestones like "100 hours listened" or "50 episodes completed"
- **And** I should be able to set personal listening goals and track progress

#### Scenario 4: Listening Insights and Analytics
- **Given** I have substantial listening data
- **When** I view detailed analytics
- **Then** I should see insights about my listening patterns and preferences
- **And** Analytics should include peak listening times, average session length, and genre preferences
- **And** I should see comparisons with previous periods and trend analysis
- **And** The app should provide personalized insights and recommendations based on patterns
