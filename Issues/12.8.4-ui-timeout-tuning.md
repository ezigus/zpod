# Issue 12.8.4: Tune UI Test Timeouts

## Priority
Low

## Status
Open

## Description
Several UI tests use generous waits (e.g., navigation loading assertions) that inflate runtime and mask slow paths. Example: BatchOperationUITests.testBasicNavigationToEpisodeList failed on a long wait (“Loading should complete within timeout”). Tightening waits where safe and adding more specific polling could reduce per-test runtime and surface regressions earlier.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Audit UI test timeouts in BatchOperationUITests and PlaybackPositionAVPlayerTests; propose stricter defaults with targeted fallbacks.
- [ ] Replace fixed sleeps (if any) with predicate-based waits.
- [ ] Demonstrate reduced test runtimes without new flakes across at least one green UI run.
- [ ] Update testing docs if new helper APIs are introduced.

## Rationale / Links
- CI failure at zpodUITests/BatchOperationUITests.swift:58 due to timeout; long waits slow the suite even when passing.

## Testing Strategy
- Local or branch run of affected suites with tightened waits; compare elapsed test time and pass rate vs baseline xcresult.
