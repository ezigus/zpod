## Description
Implement intelligent recommendation engine and AI-powered content discovery to help users find relevant podcasts based on their listening history, preferences, and behavior patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Smart Recommendations and Discovery
- **Given** I have a listening history in the app
- **When** I navigate to the recommendations section or discover tab
- **Then** App should display personalized podcast and episode recommendations based on history and preferences
- **And** Recommendations should be categorized by genre, similar podcasts, and trending content
- **And** I should be able to subscribe to recommended podcasts with one tap
- **And** Recommendation quality should improve with more listening data

#### Scenario 2: Content Filtering and Parental Controls Integration
- **Given** I want to restrict explicit content or set parental controls
- **When** I enable parental controls or set content filters in settings
- **Then** Explicit podcasts/episodes should be hidden or restricted according to preferences
- **And** Content filtering should apply to discovery, search, and recommendations
- **And** I should be able to set age-based content profiles and require approval for subscriptions
- **And** Parental control settings should require authentication to change

#### Scenario 3: AI-Powered Content Analysis
- **Given** I want intelligent content suggestions based on deep analysis
- **When** The AI system analyzes my listening patterns and preferences
- **Then** Recommendations should include content analysis showing why podcasts are suggested
- **And** Similar podcast suggestions should be based on content, not just genre
- **And** Episode-level recommendations should appear for subscribed podcasts
- **And** AI should learn from subscription/unsubscription patterns

#### Scenario 4: Trending and Community Discovery
- **Given** I want to discover popular and trending content
- **When** I browse trending and community recommendations
- **Then** I should see trending podcasts with real-time popularity metrics
- **And** Community-driven recommendations should appear based on similar users
- **And** Social proof indicators should show subscriber counts and ratings
- **And** Trending content should be filtered by time period and category
