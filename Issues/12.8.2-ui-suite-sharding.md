# Issue 12.8.2: Shard Heavy UI Suites

## Priority
Medium

## Status
Open

## Description
BatchOperationUITests and PlaybackPositionAVPlayerTests currently run as single jobs and dominate UI runtime (4–8 minutes of test payload plus simulator overhead). Sharding these suites into smaller, parallel jobs (by test class or tag grouping) should lower per-job duration and reduce rerun blast radius when a single test flakes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify shard boundaries for BatchOperationUITests (e.g., navigation vs operations) and PlaybackPositionAVPlayerTests (e.g., speed/position vs resume cases).
- [ ] Update workflow matrix to run shards in parallel without increasing total job count beyond current GitHub runner limits.
- [ ] Confirm each shard respects existing artifacts/derivative reuse and produces separate xcresult artifacts.
- [ ] Demonstrate reduced per-job wall-clock (goal: each shard ≤4 minutes of test execution).

## Rationale / Links
- CI run 21566904369: BatchOperationUITests failed after ~4m16s test time; PlaybackPositionAVPlayerTests after ~7m37s.
- Sharding isolates flakes and shortens reruns.

## Testing Strategy
- Dry-run workflow on a branch; compare suite durations vs baseline.
- Ensure shard coverage equals original suite (no tests dropped).
