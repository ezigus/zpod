## Description
Implement comprehensive batch operations for episode management and visual status tracking with progress indicators and error handling.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Comprehensive Batch Episode Operations  
- **Given** I am viewing an episode list
- **When** I tap "Select" or long-press an episode
- **Then** I should enter multi-select mode with checkboxes and visual selection indicators
- **And** I should be able to select multiple episodes using swipe gestures or "Select All" options
- **And** I should see batch action options: Download, Mark as Played/Unplayed, Add to Playlist, Archive, Delete, Share
- **And** Batch operations should show progress indicators and handle errors gracefully
- **And** I should be able to select episodes based on criteria (all unplayed, all in date range, etc.)

#### Scenario 2: Episode Status and Progress Management
- **Given** I am viewing episodes with various states (played, downloading, etc.)
- **When** I look at the episode list
- **Then** Each episode should clearly show its status with appropriate icons/indicators
- **And** I should be able to mark episodes as played/unplayed with single tap
- **And** Download progress should be visible for downloading episodes with pause/resume controls
- **And** Playback progress should be shown as a progress bar for partially played episodes

#### Scenario 3: Advanced Selection and Bulk Management
- **Given** I want to efficiently manage large numbers of episodes
- **When** I use advanced selection features
- **Then** I should be able to select episodes by criteria: "all episodes older than 30 days"
- **And** I should be able to invert selection or select all/none quickly
- **And** Selection state should be preserved during scrolling and filtering
- **And** Bulk operations should support undo functionality for safety

#### Scenario 4: Error Handling and Progress Feedback
- **Given** I am performing batch operations that may fail
- **When** Operations encounter errors or take time to complete
- **Then** I should see detailed progress indicators for each operation
- **And** Failed operations should be clearly identified with retry options
- **And** I should be able to cancel long-running operations safely
- **And** Success/failure notifications should provide clear action summaries

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Multi-Selection and Batch Interface (Week 1)
1. **Multi-Selection Implementation**
   - Create multi-select mode with visual feedback and checkboxes
   - Implement gesture-based selection with long-press and swipe
   - Add selection toolbar with batch action buttons
   - Create selection persistence during scrolling and filtering

2. **Batch Operation Framework**
   - Implement batch operation queue with progress tracking
   - Add operation cancellation and error handling
   - Create undo functionality for reversible operations
   - Add operation result notifications and summaries

### Phase 2: Status Management and Visual Feedback (Week 2)
1. **Episode Status Indicators**
   - Create comprehensive status icon system for all episode states
   - Implement progress bars for downloads and playback
   - Add visual indicators for played/unplayed states
   - Create status update animations and immediate feedback

2. **Advanced Selection Features**
   - Implement criteria-based selection with date, status, and duration filters
   - Add select all/none and invert selection functionality
   - Create selection preservation across app states
   - Add accessibility support for all selection methods

## Specification References
- `content.md`: Episode status management and bulk operations
- `ui.md`: Multi-selection interface patterns and visual feedback
- `downloads.md`: Download status and progress indication

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Issue #02 (Episode detail backend functionality)
- **Required**: Issue #04 (Download management for status integration)
- **Recommended**: Issue #06.1.1 (Playlist management for batch additions)

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Time Estimate**: 2 weeks  
**Story Points**: 9

## Success Metrics
- Batch operations on 50+ episodes complete within 30 seconds
- Zero data loss during bulk operations with proper error handling
- Episode status updates reflect immediately in the interface
- Multi-selection works smoothly across large episode lists

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Batch operation logic and status management
- **Integration Tests**: Backend integration for bulk operations
- **UI Tests**: Multi-selection interface and gesture recognition
- **Performance Tests**: Batch operation performance and memory usage
