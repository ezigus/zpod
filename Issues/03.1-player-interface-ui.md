# Issue 03.1: Player Interface UI

## Priority
High

## Status
ðŸ”„ Planned

## Description
Implement comprehensive player interface including mini-player, expanded player, and enhanced playback controls. This builds on the playback engine (Issue #03) to provide a complete audio playback experience with modern iOS design patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Mini-Player Interface
- **Given** An episode is playing or paused
- **When** I navigate away from the player tab
- **Then** A mini-player should appear at the bottom of the screen
- **And** The mini-player should show episode title, podcast name, and artwork
- **And** I should be able to play/pause and skip forward/backward from the mini-player
- **And** Tapping the mini-player should expand to the full player interface

#### Scenario 2: Expanded Player Interface
- **Given** I am in the full player view
- **When** I view the player interface
- **Then** I should see large episode artwork, full metadata, and comprehensive controls
- **And** I should see a progress slider with current time and total duration
- **And** I should have access to playback speed controls (0.8x, 1.0x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 2.0x)
- **And** I should be able to skip forward/backward by customizable intervals (15s, 30s default)

#### Scenario 3: Enhanced Playback Controls
- **Given** I am in the player interface
- **When** I interact with playback controls
- **Then** I should be able to scrub through the episode using the progress slider
- **And** I should be able to jump to specific chapters if available
- **And** All controls should be responsive and provide immediate feedback
- **And** Playback state should be preserved across app backgrounds and device locks

#### Scenario 4: CarPlay and External Control Integration
- **Given** The app is connected to CarPlay or external audio devices
- **When** I use external controls or CarPlay interface
- **Then** The player should respond to external play/pause/skip commands
- **And** Metadata should be displayed correctly on external devices
- **And** The app should maintain playback state synchronization

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Mini-Player Implementation (Week 1-2)
1. **Mini-Player Component**
   - Create persistent mini-player overlay component
   - Implement artwork, metadata, and basic controls
   - Add smooth show/hide animations

2. **Navigation Integration**
   - Integrate mini-player with tab navigation
   - Handle safe area and keyboard avoidance
   - Implement tap-to-expand gesture

### Phase 2: Expanded Player Interface (Week 2-3)
1. **Full Player Design**
   - Replace placeholder player with comprehensive interface
   - Implement large artwork display with loading states
   - Add complete metadata display (title, podcast, description)

2. **Progress and Control Interface**
   - Create responsive progress slider with scrubbing
   - Implement time displays (current/remaining/total)
   - Add skip controls with customizable intervals

### Phase 3: Advanced Controls (Week 3-4)
1. **Playback Speed Control**
   - Add speed selection interface (picker or buttons)
   - Implement speed persistence per podcast/globally
   - Add visual feedback for speed changes

2. **Chapter Navigation**
   - Add chapter list interface when chapters are available
   - Implement chapter progress indicators
   - Add quick chapter skip controls

### Phase 4: External Integration (Week 4)
1. **Lock Screen Integration**
   - Configure Now Playing info center
   - Handle remote control events
   - Implement proper artwork and metadata display

2. **CarPlay Integration**
   - Create CarPlay-optimized interface
   - Implement CarPlay navigation and controls
   - Add voice command support

- `playback.md`: Core playback features and controls
- `ui.md`: Player interface design patterns
- `advanced.md`: CarPlay and external device integration
- `customization.md`: Playback speed and skip interval preferences

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Issue #03 (Playback Engine backend)
- **Required**: Issue #02 (Episode detail for metadata)
- **Recommended**: Issue #05 (Settings for playback preferences)
- **Optional**: Issue #18 (Chapter support integration)

## Estimated Effort
**Complexity**: High  
**Time Estimate**: 4-5 weeks  
**Story Points**: 21

## Success Metrics
1. **Performance Metrics**
   - Player interface loads within 500ms
   - Smooth scrubbing with no audio dropouts
   - Responsive controls with <100ms feedback

2. **Usability Metrics**
   - Users can access player controls within 2 taps from any screen
   - All playback operations work reliably without requiring restarts
   - CarPlay integration provides distraction-free operation

3. **Accessibility Metrics**
   - Full VoiceOver support with descriptive audio feedback
   - Voice Control compatibility for hands-free operation
   - Dynamic Type support for all player text

## Risk Mitigation
- **Audio Performance**: Use dedicated audio session management
- **UI Responsiveness**: Implement efficient artwork loading and caching
- **State Management**: Ensure robust playback state synchronization
- **Memory Usage**: Optimize large artwork handling and display

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Player state management and control logic
2. **Integration Tests**: Playback engine integration and external controls
3. **UI Tests**: Complete player workflows and mini-player interactions
4. **Performance Tests**: Audio quality and UI responsiveness under load
5. **Accessibility Tests**: VoiceOver navigation and Voice Control operation
6. **CarPlay Tests**: External device integration and safety compliance
