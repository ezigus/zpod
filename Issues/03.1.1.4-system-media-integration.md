# Issue 03.1.1.4: System Media Integration & Accessibility

**GitHub Issue**: [#111](https://github.com/ezigus/zpod/issues/111)

## Priority
Medium

## Status
ðŸ†• Proposed

## Description
Wire the core player experience into iOS system services so that playback controls work from Control Center, lock screen, and external accessories, while meeting baseline accessibility requirements. This task also ensures the player surfaces are fully accessible via VoiceOver and Dynamic Type.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Register `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` metadata with artwork, title, podcast, and progress updates.
- Support remote command center actions (play/pause, skip forward/back) synchronized with in-app state.
- Configure `AVAudioSession` for background playback with correct category/options and handle interruptions (phone calls, Siri).
- Provide VoiceOver labels/hints for all player controls; Dynamic Type scaling verified for mini and expanded player layouts.
- Ensure haptic feedback is disabled when VoiceOver is active (per accessibility best practices).

## Implementation Notes
- Add media remote handling via `MPRemoteCommandCenter` bridging into playback coordinator.
- Update audio session lifecycle in AppDelegate/SceneDelegate to respect background capabilities and interruptions.
- Audit SwiftUI views for accessibility modifiers (`.accessibilityLabel`, `.accessibilityAdjustableAction`) and Dynamic Type.

## Dependencies
- Builds on UI surfaces from Issues 03.1.1.1 and 03.1.1.2 and shared state from 03.1.1.3.
- Parent: [#107](https://github.com/ezigus/zpod/issues/107).

## Testing Strategy
- Manual validation with Control Center, lock screen, and headset controls (document results in dev log).
- Unit tests for media info payload builder and remote command handlers.
- UI tests with accessibility enabled (VoiceOver simulation where feasible) to verify labels.

## Deliverables
- System integration layer handling remote commands & metadata updates.
- Accessibility adjustments for mini and expanded player.
- Documentation updates describing background playback support.
