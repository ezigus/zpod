## Description
Implement comprehensive content filtering system with intelligent content analysis, customizable safety levels, and automated content screening for family-safe podcast listening.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given/When/Then Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Intelligent Content Filtering and Safety Analysis
- **Given** I want to ensure safe, family-appropriate podcast content
- **When** I configure content filtering and safety controls
- **Then** I should be able to enable automatic content filtering with multiple safety levels (strict, moderate, permissive)
- **And** Content analysis should detect explicit language, mature themes, and inappropriate content automatically
- **And** I should be able to customize filtering criteria and create whitelist/blacklist rules for specific content
- **And** Filtering should work across all content types including episode descriptions, transcripts, and metadata

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Content Analysis and Filtering Engine (Week 1)
1. **Intelligent Content Analysis**
   - Create automated content analysis for explicit language and mature themes
   - Implement content classification using machine learning and content databases
   - Add transcript analysis for comprehensive content understanding
