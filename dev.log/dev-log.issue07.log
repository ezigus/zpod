# Issue 07 - Folder & Tag Organization | Development Log

## Wave 2 | Issue 07-Folder, Category & Tag Organization (Design)
**Date:** 2025-08-15
**Time:** 17:25 UTC
**Issue:** 07-Folder, Category & Tag Organization
**Wave:** 2 (Non-critical path)
**Dependencies Verified:** 01-Subscribe complete (podcasts available). Confirmed via existing test infrastructure.
**Spec References:** `spec/discovery.md` (Organizing Podcasts into Folders/Categories), `spec/customization.md` (Applying Custom Tags/Groups), `spec/spec.md` customization section.

**Goal:** Provide hierarchical (folders) and flat (tags) organization for subscribed podcasts with filtering APIs.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All Issue 07 requirements implemented with comprehensive test coverage and manual validation

**Implementation Summary:**
1. **Data Models:** Created `OrganizationModels.swift` with `Folder` and `Tag` structs, both Codable and Equatable
2. **Extended Podcast Model:** Added optional `folderId` and `tagIds` properties with backward-compatible serialization
3. **Management Services:** Implemented `FolderManaging` and `TagManaging` protocols with in-memory implementations
4. **Filtering APIs:** Extended `PodcastManaging` with folder/tag filtering methods including recursive folder queries
5. **Comprehensive Tests:** Created `Issue07FolderTagTests.swift` with 400+ lines covering all scenarios
6. **Manual Validation:** Standalone Swift tests confirmed all functionality works correctly

**Key Architecture Decisions Implemented:**
- String IDs for folders/tags matching existing patterns
- Hierarchical folder structure with circular reference prevention  
- Multiple tag support per podcast with flat organization
- Immutable value types following existing codebase patterns
- Protocol-oriented design enabling future extensions
- Robust error handling and validation

**Given/When/Then Scenarios Satisfied:**
✅ Multiple podcasts can be organized into hierarchical folders
✅ Podcasts can be viewed and managed by folder/category  
✅ Custom tags can be applied for flat organization
✅ Library can be filtered and organized by tags
✅ Unorganized content can be identified and managed
