## Wave 3 | Issue 08 - Advanced Search (Unified Podcasts/Episodes/Notes) - Design
**Date:** 2025-08-15
**Time:** 18:45 UTC
**Issue:** 08-Advanced Search (Unified Podcasts/Episodes/Notes)
**Wave:** 3 (after foundation stability)
**Dependencies Verified:** 
- ✅ 01-Subscribe: PodcastManager and SubscriptionService provide podcast indexing
- ✅ 03-Playback: Episode models with metadata available for indexing
- ✅ Models available: Podcast (title, author), Episode (title, description) with adequate metadata
**Spec References:** `discovery.md` (Advanced Search), `playback.md` (Advanced Search), `settings.md` (Advanced Search), `spec.md` (search scenarios across sections).

**Goal:** Implement a unified search service returning mixed podcast + episode results with pluggable index sources.

**Implementation Completed (2025-08-15 19:15 UTC):**

All components successfully implemented and verified:

1. **SearchModels.swift**: Core data types including SearchResult enum for heterogeneous results, SearchFilter options, DocumentType/FieldType enums, and Note model placeholder for future expansion.

2. **Tokenizer.swift**: Text processing with stop word filtering (35 common English stop words), punctuation removal, and normalization. Handles edge cases like empty strings and maintains word boundaries.

3. **SearchIndex.swift**: In-memory inverted index with term frequency calculation. Maps terms to IndexedDocument instances containing relevance data for fast lookup.

4. **SearchService.swift**: Main orchestration service with @MainActor annotation for Swift 6 concurrency compliance. Implements relevance scoring algorithm using term frequency × field weights, normalized by document length. Field weights: title (3x), author/description (1x).

5. **SearchIndexSources.swift**: Pluggable data sources including PodcastIndexSource and EpisodeIndexSource that connect to existing PodcastManaging infrastructure. NoteIndexSource placeholder for future notes functionality.

6. **Issue08SearchTests.swift**: Comprehensive test suite covering:
   - Tokenization (punctuation, stop words, empty strings)
   - Index operations (add, find, clear)
   - Basic search functionality
   - Type filtering (podcasts/episodes only)
   - Relevance ranking verification
   - Field weighting (title vs description)
   - Multi-term queries
   - Case sensitivity handling
   - Empty/no-match scenarios

7. **SearchIntegrationExample.swift**: Demonstration of complete integration workflow with existing PodcastManager, showing initialization, index building, and various search patterns.

**Manual Verification:** All core algorithms verified through standalone test script demonstrating tokenization, field weighting, result structure, filtering logic, and index operations work correctly.

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
✅ Query returns combined list ordered by basic relevance
✅ Able to restrict to podcasts only or episodes only
✅ Unified search interface across podcasts, episodes, and notes (placeholder)
✅ Pluggable index sources for extensibility
✅ Field weighting with title prioritization
✅ Case-insensitive search with multi-term support

**Technical Quality:**
✅ Swift 6 strict concurrency compliance with @MainActor
✅ Protocol-oriented design for testability and extensibility
✅ Memory-efficient in-memory indexing
✅ Comprehensive error handling and edge cases
✅ Clean separation of concerns (tokenization, indexing, scoring, filtering)

**Integration Points:**
✅ Connects to existing PodcastManaging protocol
✅ Leverages existing Podcast and Episode models
✅ Maintains consistency with project architectural patterns
✅ Ready for future Notes functionality expansion

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All Issue 08 requirements implemented with comprehensive test coverage and acceptance criteria validation
