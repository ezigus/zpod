## Wave 1 | Issue 04 - Download Management Core (Design)
**Date:** 2025-01-28
**Time:** Design Phase
**Issue:** 04-Download Management Core (Auto Download + Queue + Storage Policies)
**Wave:** 1 (Critical path, follows 03)
**Dependencies Verified:** Issues 01-03 complete (subscription, episode detail, playback engine available)
**Spec References:** `download.md` (Automatic Episode Download, Managing Storage and Cleanup, Prioritizing Downloads, Setting Download Conditions, Handling Failed Downloads)

**Goal:** Implement foundational download queue and policy engine enabling automatic episode downloads with storage management hooks.

**Scope (In):**
- `DownloadTask` model with state enum (`pending`, `downloading`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`) and priority system
- `DownloadQueueManager` protocol + implementation for queue operations (priority ordering, reorder, pause/resume/cancel)
- Auto-download trigger when new episode detected (hook from subscription/update service)
- `StoragePolicyEvaluator` for retention rules (keep X episodes, delete after N days) with enforcement stubs
- Basic disk persistence with `FileManagerService` (file naming scheme, directory layout)
- Failed download handling + manual retry API with error surfacing
- Comprehensive unit tests covering queue ordering, auto-download triggering, failure → retry path

**Implementation Progress:**

**Core Models Implemented:**
- ✅ `DownloadTask` model with state enum, priority system, and immutable update methods
- ✅ `DownloadState` enum with comprehensive states (pending, downloading, paused, completed, failed, cancelled)
- ✅ `DownloadError` enum with detailed error types and localized descriptions

**Services Implemented:**
- ✅ `DownloadQueueManager` protocol and `InMemoryDownloadQueueManager` implementation
- ✅ `AutoDownloadService` for new episode detection and auto-queueing with explicit settings
- ✅ `StoragePolicyEvaluator` with policy types (keepLatest, deleteOlderThan, keepUnplayedOnly)
- ✅ `FileManagerService` protocol and implementation with download simulation
- ✅ `DownloadCoordinator` orchestrating all download operations with retry logic

**Test Suite Created:**
- ✅ `Issue04DownloadTests` with comprehensive test coverage:
  - DownloadTask model initialization and state transitions
  - Queue manager operations (add, remove, reorder, pause/resume/cancel/retry)
  - Priority ordering and queue publisher functionality
  - Auto-download service with enabled/disabled podcast scenarios
  - Storage policy evaluation (keep latest, delete older than date)
  - File manager service directory creation and download progress
  - Integration tests with subscription service compatibility
  - Acceptance criteria validation tests

**Architecture Decisions Made:**
1. **Protocol-Based Design:** All services follow existing patterns with protocols for testability
2. **Immutable Updates:** DownloadTask uses `withState()`, `withProgress()` pattern like Episode model
3. **Priority Ordering:** Higher numeric values = higher priority, automatic queue sorting
4. **State Management:** Comprehensive state machine with proper transition validation
5. **Combine Integration:** Publishers for reactive queue updates following existing patterns
6. **MainActor Isolation:** Proper Swift 6 compliance with MainActor annotations
7. **Coordinator Pattern:** Central orchestration of all download operations
8. **Retry Logic:** Exponential backoff with configurable retry limits

**Integration Points:**
- ✅ Episode/Podcast model compatibility maintained
- ✅ Subscription service hook points defined for auto-download via delegate pattern
- ✅ File system abstraction for cross-platform compatibility
- ✅ Error handling patterns consistent with existing codebase
- ✅ NewEpisodeDelegate protocol for subscription service integration

**Acceptance Criteria Validation:**
- ✅ **"New episodes marked for auto-download enter queue respecting priority"** - Implemented with AutoDownloadService priority system and validated in tests
- ✅ **"Reordering queue changes execution order"** - Implemented in DownloadQueueManager.reorderQueue() and validated in tests
- ✅ **"Failed task exposes retry method and surfaces error"** - Implemented with DownloadError enum, retry tracking, and exposed via retryFailedDownload() method
