## Wave 2 | Issue 06 - Playlist & Smart Playlist System (Design)
**Date:** 2025-08-15
**Time:** Design Phase
**Issue:** 06-Playlist & Smart Playlist System (Manual Playlists + Rule-Based Smart Playlists)
**Wave:** 2 (Parallel with 05, depends on 01,03,04)
**Dependencies Verified:** 
- ✅ Issue 01-Subscribe complete (Episode model with required properties available)
- ✅ Issue 03-Playback complete (Playback infrastructure for queue generation available)
- ✅ Issue 04-Download complete (DownloadState enum for download status rules available)
- ✅ Issue 05-Settings complete (Settings framework for playlist configurations available)

**Implementation Progress:**

**Core Models Implemented:** ✅
- `Playlist` model with ordered episode IDs, playback settings (continuousPlayback, shuffleAllowed)
- `SmartPlaylist` model with rule-based filtering, sort criteria, and episode limits
- `PlaylistRuleData` for serializable rule configuration with parameters
- `PlaylistSortCriteria` enum with comprehensive sorting options
- Immutable update methods following existing patterns (`withEpisodes()`, `withName()`, etc.)

**Rule System Implemented:** ✅
- `PlaylistRule` protocol for extensible rule evaluation
- `IsNewRule`: Episodes published within X days (configurable threshold)
- `IsDownloadedRule`: Episodes with completed download status
- `IsUnplayedRule`: Episodes not played or with minimal progress (<30s)
- `PodcastIdRule`: Episodes from specific podcast
- `DurationRangeRule`: Episodes within min/max duration constraints
- `PlaylistRuleFactory`: Serialization/deserialization for rule persistence

**Engine & Manager Implemented:** ✅
- `PlaylistEngine`: Smart playlist evaluation with AND rule logic and comprehensive sorting
- `PlaylistManager` protocol: CRUD operations with change notifications
- `InMemoryPlaylistManager`: Full implementation with reactive updates via Combine
- Queue generation respecting shuffle settings and playlist allowances
- Missing episode handling (graceful filtering of deleted episodes)

**Test Suite Implemented:** ✅
- `Issue06PlaylistTests`: 30+ comprehensive unit tests covering:
  - Model initialization, validation, and Codable roundtrip
  - Rule evaluation with various episode scenarios and download states
  - Smart playlist engine with AND logic, sorting, and episode limits
  - Queue generation with shuffle support and setting respect
  - Manager CRUD operations and change notification publishing
  - Acceptance criteria validation for all requirements

**Acceptance Criteria Validated:** ✅
1. **Manual Playlist CRUD:** ✅ Can create manual playlist, add/remove/reorder episodes
2. **Smart Playlist Updates:** ✅ Smart playlist updates when underlying data changes
3. **Shuffle Support:** ✅ Shuffle flag respected when generating playback queue

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All Issue 06 requirements implemented with comprehensive test coverage and acceptance criteria validation
