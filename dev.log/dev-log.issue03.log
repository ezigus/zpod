# Issue 03 - Advanced Playback Controls | Development Log

## Wave 1 | Issue 03 - Episode Playback Engine (AVFoundation Integration) (Complete)
**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Time:** 22:15 UTC  
**Issue:** 03-Episode Playbook Engine (AVFoundation Integration)  
**Wave:** 1 (Critical path, follows 02)  
**Status:** COMPLETE ✅  
**Commits:** TBD (implementation phase)  

**Implementation Summary:**
- **Enhanced Playback Service:** Created `EnhancedEpisodePlayer` class implementing `EpisodePlaybackService` protocol with advanced features while maintaining compatibility with existing tests.
- **Playback Speed Control:** Implemented configurable playback speed (0.8x–3.0x initially, architecture supports up to 5.0x) with per-podcast and global settings.
- **Custom Skip Intervals:** Added forward/backward skip functionality with configurable intervals stored in `PlaybackSettings`.
- **Sleep Timer:** Implemented `SleepTimer` service with duration-based auto-stop, reset capability, and common duration presets.
- **Chapter Support:** Created `Chapter` model and `BasicChapterParser` for parsing chapter metadata from episode information with seeking to chapter start times.
- **Intro/Outro Skip:** Added per-podcast intro and outro skip durations applied at playback boundaries.
- **Episode State Management:** Implemented played/unplayed status tracking with `EpisodeStateManager` protocol and in-memory implementation.
- **Enhanced UI Controls:** Updated `EpisodeDetailView` with skip buttons, speed control, and chapter navigation.

**Key Implementation Decisions:**
1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Created enhanced player that works on all platforms (not just iOS with AVFoundation) for testing and development.
2. **Settings-Driven Design:** All playback preferences stored in `PlaybackSettings` model with validation and per-podcast overrides.
3. **Protocol-Based Architecture:** Extended existing `EpisodePlaybackService` protocol while maintaining backward compatibility.
4. **Chapter Integration:** Added chapter support to Episode model with automatic sorting and current chapter tracking.
5. **State Management:** Episode played status and playback position tracked via dedicated state manager for persistence.

**New Components Added:**
- `PlaybackSettings`: Model for storing playback preferences and configurations
- `Chapter`: Model representing episode chapters with start/end times and metadata
- `BasicChapterParser`: Parser for extracting chapter information from episode metadata
- `SleepTimer`: Service for automatic playback stopping with timer functionality
- `EnhancedEpisodePlayer`: Advanced playback service with all Issue 03 features
- `EpisodeStateManager`: Protocol and implementation for episode state tracking
- Updated `EpisodeDetailViewModel`: Enhanced with new controls and chapter support
- Updated `EpisodeDetailView`: UI for speed control, skip buttons, and chapter navigation

**Tests Implemented:**
- Comprehensive test suite in `Issue03PlaybackEngineTests` covering all new functionality
- PlaybackSettings validation and clamping tests
- Chapter parsing and sorting tests  
- Sleep timer functionality tests
- Enhanced player speed control, skip intervals, intro/outro handling
- Episode state management tests
- All existing Issue 02 tests continue to pass

**Architecture Preserved:**
- Ticker abstraction maintained for deterministic testing
- State machine pattern continues with enhanced states
- Combine publishers for reactive UI updates
- Service injection for testability and modularity
- MVVM pattern with enhanced ViewModels

**Deferred/Future Issues:**
- Real AVFoundation integration (platform-specific)
- Silence detection algorithm & threshold adjustment
- Volume boost / normalization DSP
- Shake gesture integration for sleep timer reset
- Transcript view integration
- Video QoS selection & Picture-in-Picture
- Background audio session management
- Now Playing / remote command integration
- Persistence layer for settings and episode state

**Technical Notes:**
- Enhanced player uses composition over inheritance to extend base functionality
- Settings model includes validation to prevent invalid configurations
- Chapter parser supports multiple metadata formats (AVMetadata, Podcast namespace)
- Sleep timer uses Foundation Timer with proper cleanup and memory management
- Episode model extended with immutable update methods for state changes
