# CarPlay Integration - Quick Start

## What Is This?

This directory contains the CarPlay integration for zPod's episode list feature, enabling safe podcast browsing while driving.

## Status: ✅ Infrastructure Complete

The CarPlay infrastructure is **fully implemented and ready for enablement**. Testing and production deployment require:
1. Apple-issued CarPlay entitlements
2. macOS environment for testing
3. Integration with podcast/episode data

## Files Overview

### Implementation
- `CarPlaySceneDelegate.swift` - Manages CarPlay scene lifecycle
- `CarPlayEpisodeListController.swift` - Handles episode list display

### Documentation
- [`/CARPLAY_SETUP.md`](/CARPLAY_SETUP.md) - Complete setup guide
- [`/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_02.1.8.md`](/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_02.1.8.md) - Technical details
- [`/Issues/02.1.8-carplay-episode-list-integration.md`](/Issues/02.1.8-carplay-episode-list-integration.md) - Requirements

- **Want to test CarPlay?** → See the testing checklist in [`CARPLAY_SETUP.md`](/CARPLAY_SETUP.md#testing)

## Key Features

✅ Driver-safe episode browsing  
✅ Large touch targets (44pt minimum)  
✅ Simplified, essential information only  
✅ Integration with existing playback engine  
✅ Ready for Siri voice control  
✅ Follows Apple CarPlay HIG  

## How It Works

```
1. User connects iPhone to CarPlay
2. CarPlaySceneDelegate sets up templates
3. User browses podcast library
4. User selects podcast → sees episode list
5. User selects episode → playback starts
6. Now Playing screen shows (system-provided)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Request CarPlay Entitlements** from Apple Developer Program
2. **Add Info.plist Configuration** (see setup guide)
3. **Implement Data Integration** (connect to podcast/episode repositories)
4. **Test in CarPlay Simulator** (requires macOS)
5. **Submit to App Store** (CarPlay apps require review)
